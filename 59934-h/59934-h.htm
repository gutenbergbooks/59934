    <p class="center">TO</p>

    <p class="smcap">Madam,</p>
    <p>Your Majesty in so readily consenting to accept the
        dedication of this humble volume, has only added one
        more to the long list of gracious favours, that I have
        constantly received at the hands of Your Majesty, ever
        since the day on which I was fortunate enough to commence
        my service, as Equerry-in-Waiting to the late King
        Edward.</p>
    <p>The portion of this book that deals with that period,
        relates something of the manifold activities of that
        monarch, and, as regards myself, is the time of my life
        to which I look back with the greatest pleasure, both
        on account of the honour it was personally to serve so
        illustrious a Sovereign, and also because of the great and
        unvarying kindness that was extended to me by my
        beloved Master and the members of his family.</p>
    <p>It has been a labour of love to write of those days,
        and has given me an opportunity of expressing, however
        inadequately, some of the gratitude that I feel towards
        those, who made the years that I spent in His Majesty&rsquo;s
        household, the happiest of my life.</p>
    <p> I have the honour to remain, Madam,<br />
        <span class="half">Always your Majesty&rsquo;s devoted servant,</span><br />

<h3>EARLY DAYS</h3>
<p>The principal excuse for this attempt to bring the
    reminiscences of a very unimportant member of the
    community to the notice of the public is that, owing to
    the series of accidents which make up what is commonly
    called life, I can claim to have had rather exceptional
    opportunities as a spectator from a great many points
    of view. Commencing my career as I did on board a
    man-of-war, I have since lived at Court, in Society,
    in Clubs, both Bohemian and Social, and during the
    seventeen years that I was on the personal staff of the
    late King Edward VII, I was necessarily brought into
    contact with a great number of persons of all sorts and
    all nations, to say nothing of seeing something of the
    daily work of a great monarch. As an example of the
    many points of view, taking a few of the more salient
    ones, with complete disregard for dates, I may instance
    that it has been my good fortune to witness the work
    of the British Army in the Field in more than one
    campaign; I was in attendance on the late King in
    Paris when he was engaged in what is possibly the
    greatest achievement of his life,&mdash;namely, laying the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> stone of our <i>entente</i> with France, and thereby probably
    saving Europe from the domination of the Teuton;
    I have seen his son, our present King George, when,
    as a young naval lieutenant, he was serving his
    country in that subordinate capacity with the same
    earnestness and devotion to duty that he has shown in
    his present exalted position; and, from another side, I
    have seen him on the polo ground, taking his part in
    the Inter-ship and Regimental Polo Matches at Malta,
    and exhibiting that same working together of hand and
    eye that has made him one of the best game shots in
    the kingdom. I have ridden many miles of messages
    for that gallant old Field-Marshal, the late Earl
    Roberts, as his Naval Aide-de-Camp in South Africa;&mdash;have
    occasionally tried to extract some information
    from the late Lord Kitchener (then the Field-Marshal&rsquo;s
    right-hand man), and have breakfasted with the Staff
    of the then General Sir John French on the Veldt. I can
    remember David Beatty as a midshipman riding racing
    ponies, in which I was frequently interested, with the
    same skill, dash, and determination that has distinguished
    him in that larger field of operations which the Armistice
    has just enabled him to quit. I have discussed at
    Henry Labouchere&rsquo;s table the possibilities of <i>Cyrano de
    Bergerac</i> as a drama for the English stage, with the late
    Sir Henry Irving; I was present in the House of
    Lords in my present post of Sergeant-at-Arms at the
    time of the fateful division when,&mdash;in spite of the
    &ldquo;die-hards&rdquo; and their venerable chief, Lord Halsbury,&mdash;that
    august body virtually voted away their own
    powers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>This long career as a Spectator of Events has resulted
    in a list of acquaintances which, like the immortal Sam
    Weller&rsquo;s knowledge of public houses, is &ldquo;extensive and
    peculiar.&rdquo; I confess to a great love of the real Artist,
    be the artist a king or a prize-fighter, and I think that,
    on the whole, this world of ours is a pleasant enough
    place to live in, always assuming that you do not expect
    too much from your fellow-man. So perhaps I may
    claim to have had more opportunities than have most
    philosophical lookers-on of seeing the inside turn of
    life in general. Having now made my excuses, I may
    as well go back and begin at the beginning.</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>I was born at my father&rsquo;s place, Castle Hill, in
    North Devon, in February 1856, so I may be said to
    have been a Crimean baby, as that expedition had not
    then arrived at its conclusion. My father, the third
    Earl Fortescue (who in those days was Viscount
    Ebrington), had always taken life seriously, and in his
    early years, before going into Parliament, where he sat
    as Member for Plymouth and Marylebone, had been
    appointed Private Secretary to Lord Melbourne,
    Queen Victoria&rsquo;s first Prime Minister, and had also
    served in the same capacity to his uncle, Lord Harrowby,
    then Foreign Secretary. During the eighteen
    years that he was in Parliament he was for four years
    Secretary to the Poor Law Board, and he seemed to
    have quite a promising Parliamentary career before
    him, when, unfortunately for him, his health was broken
    down, so far as his official life was concerned, by a
    violent attack of ophthalmia contracted whilst visiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> a military hospital when serving on a Sanitary Commission.
    This unfortunate accident completely lost
    him one eye and much weakened the sight of the
    other; so for the rest of his life he confined his
    activities to the management of his estates, to which
    he had succeeded in 1861, and to general County work.</p>

        <p class="center">THE KEEP OF TATTERSALL CASTLE</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These estates consist of small properties in Ireland,
    South Devon, Gloucester and Lincolnshire, and considerable
    property at Castle Hill in North Devon.
    The Lincolnshire property, which has since been sold
    (I believe to some speculative firm of land buyers),
    deserves a passing mention, for the Manor House of
    the property consists of the remains of the famous old
    brick castle of Tattersall. This Tattersall Estate came
    into the possession of my family about 1690, through
    the marriage of the Hugh Fortescue of that day with
    the heiress of the Earl of Lincoln, when it became her
    property (the male line of the Clinton family having
    died out), and has remained in our family until its
    recent sale. The Castle now only consists of a rectangular
    brick tower, and was built by the Lord
    Treasurer Cromwell about the year 1440, which would
    make it some few years more ancient than the other
    celebrated brick castle of Hurstmonceux. It was
    originally designed to be a place of defence and suffered
    severely during the Civil War, so much so that the then
    owner, Theophilus, fourth Earl of Lincoln, actually
    petitioned Parliament in 1649 for the damages sustained,
    but whether successfully or not I know not. The
    tower that still remains, which was probably the keep,
    is wonderfully beautiful, not only in colour but owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> to its exquisite workmanship, and it still contains the
    celebrated Norman Gothic chimney-pieces which are
    so well known to art students through their models in
    the Victoria and Albert Museum. Shortly after its
    sale, which took place a very few years ago, there was
    a report current that the old keep and its famous fire-places
    were to be pulled down, brick by brick, and sent
    over to America to be there reconstructed. Whether
    this report was true or not I cannot tell, but anyhow
    the American scheme came to nothing owing to the
    patriotism and love of archæology exhibited by Lord
    Curzon of Kedleston, who stepped into the breach and
    bought the old Castle so as to ensure its remaining in
    this country.</p>
<p>To return to my father: it is only necessary to say
    that for the many years that remained to him, after
    giving up political life, until old age and infirmity had
    limited his activities, he remained faithful to his County
    duties and was a most just and generous landlord.
    When he died at the age of eighty-seven, I believe it
    to be true that the only building on the estate, whether
    it were cottage, farm, farm-building, village school, or
    church, that was badly in need of a new roof and general
    repair was his own house. In fact, he was an excellent
    specimen of the average Victorian peer.</p>
<p>My mother, who, alas! died when I was a small boy
    ten years old, was the eldest daughter of Colonel and
    Mrs. Dawson Damer, both of whom died before I was
    born. The Colonel was a very considerable personage
    in his time. He had fought at Waterloo, and was
    earlier a member of the Military Mission that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> attached to the Emperor Alexander during Napoleon&rsquo;s
    Moscow Campaign. In 1825 he married Miss Mary
    Seymour, the daughter of Lord Hugh and Lady Horatia
    Seymour. Lady Horatia will always be remembered
    by lovers of art as the most beautiful of the three
    Ladies Waldegrave, immortalised by Sir Joshua, and
    her daughter, my grandmother, Mrs. Dawson Damer,
    was the &ldquo;little Minnie,&rdquo; Mrs. Fitzherbert&rsquo;s adopted
    daughter, so often mentioned in the Memoirs of the
    times of the Regency and the reign of George IV.
    After Mrs. Fitzherbert&rsquo;s death my grandparents lived
    in the well-known house in Tilney Street which Mrs.
    Fitzherbert had occupied for so many years and had,
    on her death, bequeathed to her adopted daughter.
    Besides the house in Tilney Street, Colonel and Mrs.
    Dawson Damer had a charming property in Dorsetshire,
    Came by name, in the neighbourhood of Weymouth,
    and it was from there that my parents were married.
    There was a great deal of entertaining done at Came
    in my grandfather&rsquo;s time. Prince Louis Napoleon,
    afterwards Napoleon III, was a constant guest there
    when he was a very poor young man about town, and
    was always said to have proposed marriage to my
    mother. I rarely believe family legends, and so used
    not to have much faith in this particular story, but
    Lord Rosebery told me some time ago that he believed
    it was perfectly true. The Colonel, who was eminently
    a man of fashion as well as a Member of Parliament,
    was one of the last of those to be concerned in a
    political duel. He did duty as second to Lord Alvanley
    when he fought Morgan O&rsquo;Connell at Wimbledon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> The cause of the duel, as is well known, was that
    O&rsquo;Connell called Alvanley a &ldquo;bloated buffoon&rdquo; in the
    House. When called out he made his usual excuse of
    having vowed never to fight another duel, and his son,
    Morgan O&rsquo;Connell, took his place. Three shots were
    exchanged on both sides and no one was hurt, but
    Greville writes in his Memoirs that O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s second
    behaved outrageously, and, had an accident occurred,
    should have been hanged.</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hardly remember my grandfather, who had married
    in 1817 Lady Susan Ryder, a daughter of the first Earl
    Harrowby; she died in 1827, but his second wife (the
    widow of an Irish Baronet), to whom he was married
    when Viceroy of Ireland, was one of the greatest friends
    of my childhood. She must have been adorably lovely
    in her youth, for in her old age she was the most
    beautiful old woman I have ever seen. Her first visit
    to England was when she settled down at Castle Hill
    after her marriage, and I well remember, in later days,
    when she was staying there, the admiration we children
    used to feel for the neat Wellington boots that always
    stood outside her bedroom door at Castle Hill, for,
    from the day she first left Ireland, she always insisted
    on wearing Wellingtons in the country as she was
    afraid of being bitten by snakes! She survived my
    grandfather for many years and died at a great age.</p>
<p>At the time of my birth the only celebrity with whom
    I came in contact was the Barnstaple doctor who
    assisted my entrance into the world. I knew him well
    when I was a schoolboy, and in his way he certainly
    was, as well as being a very good fellow, somewhat of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> a celebrity. He was the eldest of nine brothers who
    were all doctors and all practised in the West of
    England. I am positive about the number, for when
    covert shooting with him as a boy he invariably talked
    about the medical exploits of &ldquo;my brother Octavius&rdquo;
    or &ldquo;my brother Nonus,&rdquo; the two who, apparently, in
    his opinion, were the pick of the Budd family.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1859 my father, then Viscount
    Ebrington, accompanied his brother John, who had
    developed consumptive tendencies and was ordered
    abroad by his doctors, to Madeira, and, what was still
    more remarkable, elected to go there with his wife and
    children. We were then a family of seven children,
    and, as far as I can remember, from motives of economy
    we were all packed up in a sailing ship with our
    governesses and nurses, while our parents took the
    steamer to Funchal.</p>
<p>We arrived there all well after a journey lasting, I
    believe, some three weeks. We children lived for two
    years in that delightful island, and during that time
    two more of my brothers were born. Two events
    which I remember very clearly were the arrival of the
    late Empress of Austria, who came to winter there,
    with a large suite in attendance, and the arrival of
    Captain Keppel (subsequently Admiral of the Fleet Sir
    Henry Keppel) in H.M. Frigate <i>Forte</i> on his way
    to take command of the Cape of Good Hope Station.
    It was there that he met his future wife, Miss West,
    who was living with her sister in a small villa near
    the one occupied by my parents. We children, as
    a treat, were taken on board the <i>Forte</i>, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> was my first introduction to the quarter-deck of a
    man-of-war.</p>
<p>The Empress of Austria arrived about the same time
    in the royal yacht <i>Victoria and Albert</i>, which had been
    lent to Her Imperial Majesty by Queen Victoria.
    Many years afterwards, when I was serving as a
    lieutenant on board her, I was able to read in the
    journal of the Royal Yacht the account of the Empress&rsquo;
    journey across the Bay. The <i>Victoria and Albert</i> was
    the most beautiful vessel of her day and a great credit
    to our Naval Constructors, but, though capable of going
    what in those days was an unheard-of speed&mdash;about
    fifteen or sixteen knots&mdash;being under 3000 tons and a
    paddle steamer, she could get considerably knocked
    about in heavy Atlantic weather. Unluckily for the
    Empress and her travelling companions, the yacht
    encountered a severe gale, and there was a heartrending
    account in the said journal of the horrors of the passage.
    However, all things come to an end, even a bad sea
    voyage, and the Empress and her suite duly arrived and
    installed themselves in a couple of villas, or &ldquo;quintas&rdquo;
    as they were named in Madeira, in close proximity to
    the quinta where my parents lived.</p>
<p>I think that, even at that very early age, I was dimly
    conscious of the Empress&rsquo; extraordinary beauty, but
    what we children naturally liked most of all were the
    lovely little knick-knacks from Vienna which she
    showered on us,&mdash;to say nothing of the chocolates they
    generally contained.</p>
<p>I heard in after years what I believe to be the true
    reason for the Empress&rsquo; expedition. In 1859 she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> very young and conscious that she was probably the
    most beautiful woman in Europe, and naturally greatly
    resented the Emperor&rsquo;s indifference to herself and
    attention to various other ladies, of both worlds, in
    Vienna. In her dilemma she wrote and asked the
    advice of Queen Victoria. The Queen strongly advised
    her to leave Vienna for a time, and suggested that she
    should, under the plea of ill-health, go to Madeira,
    which in those days was a sort of fashionable sanatorium
    for all kinds of ailments, and placed her new
    yacht, the <i>Victoria and Albert</i>, at the disposal of the
    Empress for the journey.</p>
<p>It was at Madeira, too, that I saw for the first time
    the late Duke of Teck, the father of Her Majesty,
    Queen Mary. In those days he was a young and
    extremely handsome man, and for the moment was
    attached to the suite of the Empress, to whom he was
    related. He and my father naturally saw a great deal
    of each other, and remained friends for the rest of
    their lives.</p>
<p>We were for the greater part of two years at
    Madeira, and during that time my uncle died and was
    buried in that wonderful bower of flowers which is the
    little cemetery there.</p>
<p>The autumn of 1860 saw us on our way back to
    Europe, and the winter of 1860-61 was spent at Pau.
    In those days the railway only went as far as Dax, and
    the rest of the journey had to be done by &ldquo;diligence.&rdquo;
    I have a hazy recollection of the discomforts of that
    journey, for our <i>little</i> party consisted of nine children
    and two governesses, and I suppose a nurse or two.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> Anyhow, we must have taken up a good deal of the
    interior of that somewhat archaic vehicle, and we children
    remembered afterwards with delight the remark
    addressed to our most respectable middle-aged spinster
    governess, who was in charge of this caravan, by a
    sympathetic Frenchman: &ldquo;Mon Dieu, Madame, êtes
    vous donc la grand&rsquo;mère de <i>tous</i> ces enfants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>During our stay at Pau my grandfather died, and
    my parents settled down at Castle Hill, with 17 Bruton
    Street as their London house.</p>
<p>Naturally the next few years, which were passed
    while still in the hands of governesses and nurses,
    were absolutely colourless, but I can still remember
    some of the house parties at Castle Hill. My father,
    like all the Whigs of the early &rsquo;sixties, was greatly
    interested in the Italian movement. Various Italian
    celebrities used to undertake the long journey down
    to Devonshire, I suppose to make the acquaintance
    of a specimen of an English country house and to
    see a week of English country life. It was our great
    amusement as children, just before being packed off
    to bed, to lean over the gallery which surrounded the
    hall when the guests were assembling before dinner,
    and watch them processing into the dining-room, and
    I can well remember our childish delight and wonder
    at the behaviour of the Italians, who invariably went
    in to dinner, as was the custom in those days on the
    Continent, with their gibus hats under their arms.</p>
<p>For the next few years Castle Hill and Bruton
    Street were my alternate homes in their respective
    seasons, and one of the impressive ceremonies I remem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>ber
    was being allowed to see our parents dressed up
    for Court, and, greatest joy of all, to see them driven
    away in a coach with a footman behind, and one of
    my dearest friends, the coachman, in a wig and state
    livery, enthroned on his hammer-clothed box. How
    smart were the carriages in London in those days, and
    how paltry do the most expensive Rolls-Royce cars
    appear in comparison! Even on ordinary occasions
    the whole of London Society, which in those days
    was small and select, used to take their afternoon
    drives in barouches. In our turn, we children used
    to drive in the sacred vehicle with our mother. It
    was very magnificent. To drive in a barouche in
    London in the height of the Season was rather a
    solemn affair and not particularly amusing, and the
    only redeeming feature I remember was that at the
    end of the outing the carriage used to pull up under
    the trees in Berkeley Square, and, delight of delights!
    strawberry ices used to be brought to us from Gunter&rsquo;s
    to consume in the carriage, and that admirable institution,
    I am glad to see, still keeps its hospitable doors
    open. It was one of the sights of the London Season
    to see the carriages pulled up in the shade of the
    trees, full of children consuming strawberry ices. I
    insist on strawberry ices, for, as far as I can remember,
    no child ever dreamt of asking for any other.</p>
<p>The expression &ldquo;dearest friend&rdquo; as regards the
    coachman was certainly no mere figure of speech.
    The two men a boy loves best in the world are the
    two who teach him how to ride and how to shoot.
    My friend of the hammer-clothed box did the former,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> the tuition of the latter fell to the lot of the butler.
    The butler&rsquo;s business is generally supposed to lie in
    another direction, but in our particular case he was
    undoubtedly the right person, as, apart from his other
    dignities, he had the high honour of being own
    brother to the head gamekeeper.</p>
<p>The early years slipped away in the happy childhood
    that is always ensured by being one of a large family
    of children treading close on one another&rsquo;s heels. For,
    by the time I went to school in 1865, there were
    exactly a dozen of us,&mdash;no very unusual number in
    those days of large families. Our nearest neighbour
    and kinsman, the Lord Portsmouth of that day, was
    the happy father of nine, and to go back another
    generation or two, I was always led to believe that
    my step-grandmother, to whose Wellington boots I
    have already alluded, was one of a family of over
    twenty.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1865 my eldest brother&mdash;my
    senior by a little over a year&mdash;and I were sent to
    school at Brighton. The owner and manager of this
    establishment was an old lady, Mrs. Walker by name,
    and, as was inevitable in those days, the school came
    to be known by the name of Hookey&rsquo;s. This school,
    one way and another, earned an excellent reputation,
    and I suppose was quite as good as any other preparatory
    school for Eton and Harrow, to one of which
    schools nearly all the boys went eventually. Certainly
    the boys of my time achieved, as a lot, very considerable
    success in after life. Out of about sixty boys,
    who must have passed through there during my time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> I can remember three Lytteltons, known to us as
    Bob, Edward and Alfred: the eldest of the three is
    now a well-known solicitor, the second was Headmaster
    of Haileybury and Eton, and the youngest
    was one of the most brilliant men of his time, not
    only as a born athlete, but in the House of Commons,
    and in the Cabinet as Colonial Secretary. I also
    recollect two Northcotes, one being the late Lord
    Northcote, a most successful Colonial Governor-General;
    the late Sir Michael Herbert, whose much-to-be-regretted
    early death had not prevented him
    from rising to the rank of Ambassador at an unusually
    early age; Colonel à Court Repington, the well-known
    writer on military subjects; my own younger brother,
    John, now a distinguished man of letters; my cousin,
    the late Lord Portsmouth, and his next two brothers,&mdash;the
    late peer was at one time Under-Secretary of
    State for War; the present Lord Strathmore and his
    brothers; and a good sprinkling of boys who subsequently
    became soldiers, many of whom,&mdash;including
    my brother, Lionel, who was killed in South Africa,&mdash;have
    met a bullet in the wars, great and small, of the
    last forty-five years.</p>
<p>Poor old Hookey! She was a good old woman
    and a terrific snob. It speaks well for the sense of
    humour of the school when I can aver that its best
    mimic always had his greatest success when he gave
    his imitation of the old lady showing parents of possible
    prospective pupils over the school. She invariably
    used to produce, apparently out of her sleeve and
    quite by accident, all the eldest sons, the regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> formula being: &ldquo;That boy is Lord Blank, Earl Dash&rsquo;s
    son. Come here, Blank, my dear; I am so glad to
    learn from your tutor that you are first in your class
    this week.&rdquo; If there happened to be a slump in eldest
    sons, even a wretched &ldquo;honourable&rdquo; would be produced
    as a makeshift; but as we were well supplied
    with Viscounts this very seldom happened.</p>
<p>My holidays were passed entirely at Castle Hill,
    and hunting became the great joy of the summer and
    winter holidays, for, in addition to the fox-hunting
    provided by our kinsman and neighbour, Lord Portsmouth,
    the Devon and Somerset Staghounds used to
    begin their season in mid-August, and it was in
    August 1866 that I was formally entered to the sport
    of stag-hunting, having been in at the death of a
    hunted stag after a terrifically long run. My eldest
    brother and I were both baptised at the same time,
    having both managed to get to the end on our
    Exmoor ponies. The ceremony of blooding was performed
    by the Rev. John Russell, the well-known
    sporting parson, generally known as Jack Russell, who,
    in those days, was vicar of a neighbouring parish and
    esteemed to be the greatest authority on hunting,
    whether of the stag, the fox, the otter, or the hare,
    that lived in the West Country. We got home
    somewhere about ten o&rsquo;clock that night and fought
    ferociously to prevent the blood being washed off our
    faces before being packed off to bed.</p>

<h3>GUNROOM LIFE IN THE &rsquo;SEVENTIES</h3>
<p>During my school days, owing, I suppose, to my
    thorough dislike of the whole process of education, I
    made up my mind to go into the Navy if I could get
    the necessary permission from my father, so as to
    escape from school once and for all. I am afraid that
    I had not reckoned on the amount of elementary
    mathematics, which I detested even more than Latin
    grammar, that was to be forced into me during the
    fifteen months&rsquo; training in the <i>Britannia</i>. Anyhow it
    was decreed that the Navy should be my profession,
    and I was taken down to Portsmouth in the summer
    of 1869 to try to pass the examination for candidates
    for Naval Cadetships, the necessary nomination having
    been procured through the kindness of a cousin of my
    mother, then Captain Beauchamp Seymour, Naval
    Private Secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty
    of that day, who subsequently became Admiral Lord
    Alcester, of whom more anon.</p>
<p>Naturally, every candidate was submitted to a medical
    examination which took place at Haslar Hospital. In
    those days Army and Navy Surgeons had not developed
    into lace-clad Generals and Inspector-Generals. (Incidentally
    I can never understand why a man who is by
    profession a doctor or surgeon should want to call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> himself a colonel. To my mind a captain in the Navy
    might just as logically call himself a dean, or a commander-in-chief
    an archbishop!) The Superintendent
    of Haslar was a Post-Captain, Wodehouse by name.
    He had lately returned from commanding a line-of-battleship
    in the Mediterranean, Admiral Sir Robert
    Smart being his Commander-in-Chief at that time.
    It was always spread abroad that Captain Wodehouse
    was on extremely bad terms with Bobby Smart, which
    was the pet name of his Commander-in-Chief, but, on
    the other hand, his great friend on the Station was the
    French Commander-in-Chief, who in those days was
    very apt to be at Malta with his squadron, as the <i>entente</i> which existed during the Crimean Campaign
    was still kept going during the late &rsquo;sixties. As may
    be imagined, he did not have many opportunities of
    getting even with his Chief, but on one occasion he
    may be said to have had the best of it. His vessel
    was leaving Malta for England and was moving
    majestically out of the Grand Harbour, Valetta, with
    the band on the poop and all the usual pomp and
    circumstance. Wodehouse knew that the French
    Admiral was on board the English flagship, so as a
    parting shot, as he passed under the flagship&rsquo;s stern,
    the band was ordered to play, &ldquo;Robert, toi que j&rsquo;aime.&rdquo;
    This affecting farewell was a delight to the Frenchman,
    who could not resist telling Smart how fond he was of
    &ldquo;ce cher Wodehouse qui avait tant d&rsquo;esprit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I succeeded in passing my examinations, both
    medical and scholastic, all right, and after a few weeks&rsquo;
    suspense I was informed by the Admiralty that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> to join the <i>Britannia</i> at Dartmouth in September. That
    training-ship has so often been described that I do not
    think it necessary to say much about it; but a few
    words may be written about the impressions that my
    first introduction to the Navy conveyed to my youthful
    mind. The Captain of the <i>Britannia</i> was at that time
    Captain Corbett, a very distinguished officer, and, to
    the cadets, an awe-inspiring figure when he inspected
    our ranks on Sundays with his ribbon of the C.B.
    (a really prized distinction in days when orders and
    ribbons were very sparsely bestowed), and the sash
    over his shoulder that was then worn by the Naval
    Aide-de-Camp to the Sovereign. The fashion in hair
    at that time was very different from the present Navy
    fashion, when everyone is either bearded or clean-shaven.
    In 1869, just before Mr. Childers allowed beards to
    be grown, every officer and man had to shave his upper
    lip and chin, the result being that the young bloods
    of the quarter and lower decks delighted in appearing
    in long Dundreary whiskers.</p>
<p>The <i>Britannia</i> was a good school in its way, for the
    amount of hard knowledge in the shape of the elements
    of navigation and mathematics that we were made to
    absorb in twelve months was rather remarkable; but
    the old hulk was not particularly sanitary, and we were
    shamefully underfed, considering the amount of school
    work and drill that we had to do. During my year
    there I personally lost a good deal of time owing to a
    simultaneous outbreak of smallpox and scarlatina that
    occurred in 1870. I was unfortunate enough to develop
    the scarlatina and was at once put behind a canvas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> screen, which was supposed to separate me from my
    fellow-cadets, whilst waiting for the boat to take me
    ashore to the sick quarters. Unfortunately for me,
    another cadet was attacked with smallpox that same
    morning; so, to save trouble, we two wretched boys
    were coupled together behind the same screen, for,
    as the doctor sagely remarked, it was very uncommon
    for anybody to have smallpox and scarlatina at the
    same time. I, unfortunately, thanks to his speculative
    philosophy, succeeded in getting both, with the result
    that I was extremely ill, and was put considerably back
    with my studies.</p>
<p>There is no period of my life that I look back upon
    with less pleasure than I do to the time I spent in the <i>Britannia</i>. Whilst admitting that the instruction was
    good&mdash;indeed very good&mdash;it was rather overdone considering
    the average age of the boys&mdash;between thirteen
    and fifteen&mdash;and, as I have already said, the food was
    disgracefully bad and scanty. To show how hungry
    we were, it became a regular practice of the cadets
    when passing a bluejacket to drop a handkerchief with
    sixpence knotted into the corner, the handkerchief
    being surreptitiously returned in the course of a few
    minutes with bits of ship&rsquo;s biscuit wrapped up in it
    instead of the sixpence. I think that all of us&mdash;and
    by all of us I mean the fifty cadets who had joined
    together in the autumn of 1869&mdash;were rejoiced when
    our release came in December 1870. I was fortunate
    enough to take a first-class, which meant that I was
    raised to the dignity of a midshipman at once instead
    of having to wait for three, six or nine months, accord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>ing
    to the class taken on passing out. I may as well
    confess that, as a matter of fact, I was first of the whole
    term, and was probably conceited and odious on the
    strength of it. The conceit only lasted till I joined
    a sea-going ship, where, naturally, no one cared a straw
    whether a midshipman was first or last when he left
    the <i>Britannia</i>; and as I had acquired a certain amount
    of philosophy, even at that early age, it was brought
    home to me that the only individual who benefited
    in the least by my exploits was my father, for the
    grateful country bestowed a regulation dirk and a spy-glass
    upon me as prizes, both of which necessaries
    would otherwise have been supplied by an outfitter and
    paid for by my parent.</p>
<p>And now to mention some of my contemporaries
    who have arrived at distinction. A good many of the
    survivors I still meet from time to time, and they
    include Admiral Sir Berkeley Milne, Admiral of the
    Fleet Sir Hedworth Meux, and that really authentic
    specimen of the &ldquo;bravest of the brave,&rdquo; Admiral Sir
    James Startin. Jimmy Startin, from his youth up, was
    one of those very rare and fortunate individuals who
    have absolutely no sense or knowledge of fear. He has
    distinguished himself by his splendid personal bravery
    a hundred times, but perhaps never more so than
    when, as a man of over sixty years of age and Commodore
    of a squadron of patrol vessels, he boarded a
    burning patrol vessel that was in momentary danger
    of blowing up and attempted to rescue the engineer
    of that vessel. For this gallant exploit he was decorated
    by the King with the Albert Medal, and I cannot do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> better than quote the official account which appeared
    in the <i>London Gazette</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;<i>Gazette</i>, 20th August, 1918:&mdash;</p>
    <p class="center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Admiral Sir James Startin, K.C.B.</span></p>
    <p>&ldquo;An explosion occurred on board H.M. Motor-launch 64
        on the 10th June, 1918. Immediately after the explosion
        Commodore Startin proceeded alongside Motor-launch 64,
        the engine-room of which was still burning fiercely. On
        learning that the engineer was below he sprang down the
        hatch without the slightest hesitation and succeeded in recovering
        the body practically unaided. In view of the fact that
        the bulkhead between the engine-room and the forward tanks
        had been blown down by the force of the explosion, and that
        the fire was blazing upon the side and on the top of the forward
        tanks, which are composed of extremely thin metal, and
        consequently were liable to burst at any moment, the action
        of Commodore Startin in entering the engine-room before
        the fire was subdued showed the utmost possible gallantry and
        disregard of personal safety. Had the engineer not been past
        human aid he would undoubtedly have owed his life to the
        courage and promptitude of Commodore Startin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course there were several others who arrived at
    the rank of Admiral, and amongst them may be
    mentioned a very dear old friend, the late Sir Frederick
    Hamilton, who, after serving as Second Sea Lord and
    as Commander-in-Chief at Rosyth during the War,
    practically succumbed as the result of a long period of
    overwork.</p>
<p>After the labours of the <i>Britannia</i> a fairly long
    holiday was very pleasant, and my first appointment
    after a Christmas spent at home, was to the guardship,
    H.M.S. <i>Duke of Wellington</i>, at Portsmouth, whilst
    waiting to be appointed to a sea-going ship. Any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>thing
    worse for the morals and discipline of a number
    of lads of our age than life aboard the guardships of
    those days, it is hard to imagine. We were nearly a
    hundred in the mess. In the gunroom there were a
    certain number of sub-lieutenants and assistant paymasters
    who were actually serving in the ship for
    various duties and were known as &ldquo;standing numbers.&rdquo;
    The steward treated them on a sort of favoured nation
    basis, supplying them with all the best of the food at
    minimum prices, wisely making a large profit out of
    the supernumeraries like ourselves, who, being there
    for only a short time&mdash;anything from a few days to a
    few months&mdash;were obviously sent there by Providence
    and the Admiralty for that particular object. There
    was one very remarkable specimen of a &ldquo;standing
    number&rdquo; of a gunroom mess in the guardship at that
    time. He was an elderly, white-haired gentleman of
    about fifty years of age&mdash;a man of fifty is certainly
    elderly for a gunroom. His rank was that of Acting
    Navigating Sub-Lieutenant. He had passed his
    preliminary examination for Master&rsquo;s Mate, as they
    were then called, some thirty years before, had never
    presented himself for the final examination&mdash;which,
    successfully passed, would have confirmed him in his
    rank&mdash;and so an acting master&rsquo;s mate or sub-lieutenant
    he had remained ever since.</p>
<p>The <i>Duke of Wellington</i> period lasted only a very
    few weeks, but long enough to earn me my first
    certificate from my first captain afloat, Captain the
    Hon. Richard Carr Glyn, then Flag-Captain to the
    Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth, and who sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>sequently
    commanded the <i>Serapis</i> on the occasion of
    the late King Edward&rsquo;s visit to India when Prince of
    Wales. The certificate I allude to was bestowed on all
    officers by all the captains under whom they served,
    whether for days or years, and to my mind was couched
    in the most insulting terms. I suspect it to have been
    composed by some more than usually red-tapeist
    specimen of an Admiralty clerk in the early part of the
    Victorian period. It ordained that whatever else the
    captain liked to say about an officer he had to testify
    in writing to his sobriety. I remember, years afterwards,
    when I had arrived at a rank that made it my
    province to give, instead of to receive, these benefits,
    the joy with which I destroyed some dozens of them
    testifying to my sobriety over a period of some thirty
    years. I wonder if they still exist! The permanent
    officials and civilian clerks at the Admiralty are not
    fond of change, unless it takes the shape of an increase
    to their own pay, and, human nature being usually
    much alike, were I one of them I should probably
    take exactly the same view as they do.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1871, when I first went to sea, the
    Admiralty had instituted a system of sea-going training-ships,
    which was abandoned a few years later and
    revived, I believe, shortly before the War in a new
    scheme of education which was devised by Lord
    Fisher as First Sea Lord. I could never understand
    why the Admiralty ever did away with it, for, in my
    opinion, it worked excellently well, and to modernise
    it and bring it up to the present date it was only
    necessary to divert the time and instruction that used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> to be devoted to masts and sails to marine engineering,
    wireless telegraphy and torpedo work. However,
    this dissertation has nothing to do with my reminiscences,
    so I must return to my story.</p>
<p>The whole of my &ldquo;term&rdquo; in the <i>Britannia</i>, still some
    fifty strong, was appointed to H.M.S. <i>Bristol</i>, a frigate
    of between 2000 and 3000 tons that had done duty
    as flagship at the Cape of Good Hope Station. Our
    Captain, the Hon. Walter Carpenter, was thus able
    to take up his abode in the quarters designed for
    an admiral, under the poop, the ordinary captain&rsquo;s
    quarters being turned into a mess-room and school-room
    for the young gentlemen under training. The
    ship had her usual complement of officers and men,
    and carried, in addition, an extra lieutenant, sub-lieutenant
    and assistant paymaster, and two naval
    instructors for special duties connected with the
    cadets. Practically the onus of directing our training
    fell upon one man, Lieutenant Day Hort Bosanquet,
    who, many years afterwards, I knew as Commander-in-Chief
    at Portsmouth. Certainly, it could not have
    fallen into better hands. He was a thoroughly good
    fellow and a gentleman, to begin with, and a first-rate
    seaman and disciplinarian to go on with, and though
    he kept us all in terrific order he was none the less
    very popular.</p>
<p>We were worked hard; but anything was preferable
    to our late home, the <i>Britannia</i>. The routine was
    somewhat as follows:&mdash;We were turned out of our
    hammocks just after 6 a.m. Then came gun drill,
    rifle-drill or sail-drill on alternate mornings; breakfast at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> 8 a.m.; after breakfast we were inspected, and after
    prayers at 9 a.m. we were put into the hands of the
    naval instructors till dinner time at noon. At 1.15
    more school or drill of some sort, and about 5 p.m. the
    ship&rsquo;s company would be at sail-drill for the best part
    of an hour, and we shared in their exercises of shifting
    sails, masts, reefing topsails, and all the man&#339;uvres
    that were dear to the smart naval officer of that day.
    In a very short time we had complete charge of the
    mizzen masts and drilled against the men at the fore
    and main. After evening drill was over we were left
    in peace except for about an hour&rsquo;s preparation work
    for the next day&rsquo;s studies. On alternate weeks we
    kept regular night and day watch under the officers
    of the ship, and though it was a sad struggle to turn
    out of one&rsquo;s hammock, at midnight after a long day,
    to keep the middle watch, the discomfort and want
    of sleep so necessary for a young growing boy was
    almost made up for, when the weather was fine and
    warm, by the beauty of those tropical nights when the
    ship was bowling along under easy sail running down
    the trades. All our passages were made under sail,
    for the steam engine in those days was very rarely
    requisitioned unless the ship was becalmed for a very
    long time or was entering or leaving a port, to sail in
    and out of which was impossible. In those days, I
    regret to have to say, gunnery in the Navy was terribly
    neglected, principally on account of the craze which
    existed for smartness aloft. And there was considerable
    excuse for it, for the upper yardmen of that time
    were, to my mind, the finest specimens of humanity I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> have ever met. From constantly running the rigging
    at top speed, they were in the highest state of training;
    they were as active as cats and as brave as lions; for,
    if once a man showed, when aloft, the smallest
    desire to hold on with one hand and work with the
    other, instead of chancing everything and working
    with both, he was useless as an upper yardman, and
    was at once relegated to safer and less ambitious
    duties. And so the tradition went on and descended
    to us. The only quality we really admired in our
    superior officers was their seamanship. Anything in
    the shape of science was a bore, and the only part of
    the gun-drill that interested us was the part that
    resembled seamanship; the shifting of tackles and
    breeching, and transporting the 64-pounders which
    formed our armament to a different position, the
    whole business of the gun in those days having to
    be done by quoins, handspikes and tackle. When
    it came to gun practice, which consisted in firing at a
    cask with a small flagstaff bobbing about in the sea,
    the one object was to get it over as soon as possible,
    as it was looked upon as distinctly uninteresting.
    Notwithstanding this defect, I still think that, in those
    days, the sea-going training did us boys a great deal
    of good. Amongst other advantages, when visiting
    foreign ports we were made to go and see the principal
    sights whether we liked it or not. Probably famous
    cathedrals, world-famous panoramic views, and such
    like, did not appeal to many of us, and we would
    far sooner have been left to our own resources; but
    in after life I have become grateful to those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> first introduced me to some of the wonders of the
    world.</p>
<p>The <i>Bristol</i> sailed away from Portsmouth in February
    1871 on an eminently fine-weather cruise, most
    suitable for the raw material on board her. There is
    always some sort of a swell when crossing the Bay, and
    the new hands were nearly all sea-sick. As for myself,
    I am proud to say that I was one of the exceptions;
    this immunity was due, I suppose, to the previous
    voyage that I had made on a sailing ship to Madeira
    some dozen years before. Madeira, as a matter of
    fact, was our first port of call, and it was interesting to
    me to see how much I could remember of that lovely
    island. A very few days after we were rolling along
    in the trades on our way to Rio de Janeiro. At Rio
    a long stay was made, for the ship required a certain
    amount of refitting after nearly a month at sea under
    sail, and leave had to be given to the men. The cadets
    were taken in a body to Petropolis, a lovely place up
    in the hills which was the summer residence of the
    Court and the Corps Diplomatique. The beauty of
    Rio has been so often described by far abler pens than
    mine that I refrain from giving any childish impressions
    of it; but what we enjoyed most, I well remember,
    was the drive back from Petropolis in large coaches
    with four horses, the one I was in being actually driven
    by an old Yorkshire stage-coachman, who had found
    his way out to Brazil.</p>
<p>The only very distinct memory I have of the actual
    town of Rio of those days (I am glad to say I have revisited
    it since) was the peculiarity of the currency.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> In 1871 a tramway ticket for an ordinary length of fare
    was equivalent to sevenpence, English. For this same
    ticket, anything of a similar value from a hair-cut to a
    cocktail could be purchased, and with a pocket full of
    tickets a great deal of purchasing could be done. It
    was like shopping in a small provincial town with a
    pocket full of sixpences. After leaving Rio, the <i>Bristol</i> stood down to the southward and presently picked up
    the &ldquo;Roaring Forties,&rdquo; as the strong prevailing westerly
    winds which are found about 40º south of the equatorial
    line are called, and stood across to the Cape of Good
    Hope, our next port of call. Next to fishing for
    albatross, with a bit of meat on the end of a hook
    and a long fishing line,&mdash;a sport which was occasionally
    successful,&mdash;the greatest excitement was when, as midshipman
    of the watch, it came to one&rsquo;s turn to heave
    the log, for, with half a gale behind, the old ship was
    really travelling, and our great ambition was to be able
    to chronicle an actual run of 50 nautical miles in the
    watch. A steady 12&frac12; knots for four hours consecutively
    was not so very easily accomplished, and did not
    happen very often. It has to be confessed that the <i>Bristol</i> was not a very fast frigate, and compared very
    badly as a sailer with my next two ships of the same
    class.</p>
<p>Well, we finally arrived at Simon&rsquo;s Bay, and once
    more leave and refitting took place, and there I certainly
    spent some of the happiest days of my early youth,
    thanks to the hospitality of an acquaintance who had a
    large farm in the neighbourhood of Constantia, about
    half-way between Simon&rsquo;s Bay and Cape Town. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> kind man, Watermeyer by name, had married a
    daughter of the Rector of Filleigh, the village of Castle
    Hill, and hearing that I was on board, asked permission
    to take me and a friend away for a week to stay with
    him. My friend on this occasion was another cadet of
    the same standing who was also a cousin, Francis
    Stuart Wortley, the present Lord Wharncliffe. Leave
    having been granted, we were driven off in glory in
    Mr. Watermeyer&rsquo;s Cape cart, and after a drive of some
    fifteen miles, principally along the coast, we arrived at
    our destination. It was one of those typically Dutch
    houses, with a stoop or verandah all round, so well
    suited to the fierce heat of that delightful climate.
    Our hostess was delighted to meet old and new friends
    and made us most welcome, and later on, when the
    time came to go to bed, it was a pleasure to sleep in a
    good English bed again, in a room all to oneself, after
    being accustomed to have one&rsquo;s worldly surroundings
    limited to a sea-chest and a hammock. And what a
    pleasant country it was! We used to ride for miles
    over the flats, which would have made an ideal hunting
    country, except for the absence of fences, and were
    shown the various business establishments in the
    neighbourhood. These were principally connected
    with the wine-making trade, for vines flourished exceedingly
    in that part of the Colony, and wine-making
    was a very thriving industry.</p>
<p>The world is very small and very round. Nearly
    forty years later, during the South African War, it
    was my fate to meet my old friend&rsquo;s son, then attached
    to Lord Robert&rsquo;s Staff as Colonial Aide-de-Camp, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> being Naval Aide-de-Camp to his Lordship at the
    time.</p>
<p>After a delightful week of freedom, we were back
    on board again, and now our bows were turned for
    home. St. Helena, Ascension, Madeira, and Gibraltar,
    were visited in succession, and we finally anchored at
    Spithead after an excellent cruise.</p>
<p>The Admiralty had meanwhile decided that our time
    in training was to be extended, and as the <i>Bristol</i> was
    about done for, we cadets&mdash;who, by the way, were by
    this time nearly all midshipmen, were turned over to
    the <i>Ariadne</i>, a larger and far more beautiful vessel than
    our late one. The <i>Ariadne</i> was one of the crack
    frigates of her time. She sailed very well and had been
    selected for the use of the Prince and Princess of Wales
    in the spring of 1867, when their Royal Highnesses
    made their Eastern trip to Egypt, Turkey, the Crimea,
    and Greece.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By this time the season of Christmas was close by.
    We were all given leave for Christmas, and early in the
    New Year joined the <i>Ariadne</i>. Our next destination
    was the Mediterranean, and, timed to arrive at Malta,
    as we were, in the early spring, as far as climate and
    surroundings were concerned, nothing could be pleasanter.
    Our first passage from Portsmouth to Gibraltar
    was marred by a very bad boat accident. We were
    crossing the Bay heading for Finisterre, running before
    a strong breeze and rather a tumbling sea, when, unfortunately,
    a man fell overboard. A life-buoy was let
    go, and the ship was at once brought to the wind and
    hove-to; but she was a very long ship for those days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> and by the time she was hove-to the man was some
    way off. The life-boat cutter was lowered and pulled
    off in the direction of the life-buoy. Unfortunately,
    the breeze was freshening, and the sea was becoming
    heavier every minute, the situation thus becoming
    unpleasant. Meanwhile, the boat&rsquo;s crew having ascertained
    that the man was no longer hanging on to the
    buoy&mdash;he had let go, doubtless, from exhaustion&mdash;tried
    to turn round and return to the ship. In turning,
    always a very dangerous man&#339;uvre in a bad sea, she
    broached-to and was swamped. Another boat was
    immediately manned, but owing to the heavy rolling
    of the ship she swamped alongside, and there we were
    with about five-and-twenty men struggling in the water,
    and with practically no other boat to lower that was big
    enough to stand such a sea. Steam had been got up
    meanwhile, and the ship, with great difficulty, was
    brought as near the survivors as possible. A certain
    number we managed to get on board with ropes, but
    the loss was heavy, for out of those two crews we lost
    eleven men and two officers. Of the two officers something
    more must be said. By a curious coincidence
    those two men had been such bitter enemies during the
    whole time they had been messmates on board the <i>Bristol</i> and <i>Ariadne</i>, that they had never been known
    to speak to each other except on duty when the
    exigencies of the Service so required. When the first
    boat was manned they both happened to be on deck;
    they both, with the instinct of gallant men, jumped
    into the cutter as volunteers, and the senior of the two
    took charge of the boat. They were both drowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> together, and it was always a wonder to my youthful
    mind as to whether, with death staring them in the face
    and only a question of a few minutes, they ever made
    up their paltry quarrel? There was yet another
    curious incident connected with this affair. Two of the
    men who were in the boats&rsquo; crews were survivors of the <i>Captain</i>, a vessel which was lost with nearly all hands
    and which was still much talked of in the Navy; both
    these men were saved, and after two such escapes, it
    seemed evident that Providence never intended that
    either of them should drown.</p>
<p>The next six months were passed in the <i>Ariadne</i> cruising in the Mediterranean; Malta, the headquarters
    of the Mediterranean Fleet, being our most
    frequent port of call.</p>
<p>Once again I feel tempted to write a description&mdash;a
    temptation that must once more be resisted, for no
    one but the practised artist should be allowed to attempt
    to describe, and, moreover, the Grand Harbour of
    Valetta has been so often dealt with. But the subject,
    like the place itself, has an endless charm for me. For
    ten years, off and on, I was on the Mediterranean
    Station; on countless occasions I have gone in and
    out of the Grand Harbour, for I have often revisited
    the place in later years; yet, were I transported there
    to-morrow, I feel sure that I should be as much
    impressed with its beauty and charm as ever. I know
    no place where there is such a feast of brilliant colour
    as is to be met when steaming to a buoy up the Grand
    Harbour. Every creek that is passed swarms with
    gondola-shaped <i>dhaisas</i>, painted with all the colours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> of the rainbow, the rich ochre-colour of the beautiful
    old fortifications, interspersed with the residential
    dwellings, many of which are pink with green shutters,
    and the whole sandwiched, as it were, between the
    deep blue of the sky and the still deeper blue of the
    Mediterranean, make up a picture which, to me, is
    unforgettable. It was at Malta, too, that I really
    began my operatic career as a spectator; for, though
    I had heard Madame Patti at Covent Garden when
    I was nine years old, it was at Malta, that I first
    became an habitué. It was a cheap luxury in those
    days, the stalls costing only half a crown, and even
    a Naval Cadet could occasionally afford himself that
    amount of pleasure. Every one in musical circles of
    Valetta was still raving about the then newly discovered
    prima donna, Emma Albani, who had fairly captured
    their hearts during the winter season of 1871, when
    she had sung continually at the Opera House of Valetta
    before being whisked away to start her triumphant
    career in London and the world in general. Though,
    alas! Albani had gone, the opera was not at all bad,
    and as going there was allowed, it was also an excuse
    for being ashore in the evening; and so I spent a
    great many pleasant hours in that well-ordered little
    Opera House.</p>
<p>A visit to Naples, was of course, inevitable on an
    instructional cruise, and the <i>Ariadne</i> spent some time
    there also. The &ldquo;young gentlemen&rdquo; were duly taken
    to Herculaneum and Pompeii to improve their minds,
    and I had the chance of hearing more operatic performances
    in that colossal Opera House, San Carlo, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> moreover, of studying for the first time the manners
    and customs of an Italian audience. Fiercely critical,
    with apparently a natural intimate knowledge of singing,
    the members of the audience would almost conduct
    the singer on the stage by their incessant remarks.
    They could be the most enthusiastic audience in the
    world when really pleased; but, should an unfortunate
    singer fail to please them, their brutality (there is no
    other word!) was frankly disgusting. I remember
    a poor woman singing at San Carlo. She had been
    a first-class artist in her time, but her voice showed
    signs of wear and tear, and the Neapolitans had had
    enough of her. Six times running was this poor
    creature made to repeat her aria in order that the
    audience might give themselves the pleasure of hissing
    and hooting her, to say nothing of hurling obscene
    curses at her across the foot-lights. Were I an artist
    I fancy I should prefer the cold Covent Garden
    audience, who, though inclined to be unenthusiastic,
    at any rate could never be induced to insult a woman.</p>
<p>Our stay at Naples was very pleasant, for our
    taskmasters gave us a good deal of leave, wisely
    encouraging us youngsters to see everything of interest
    in the neighbourhood, and in an old photograph-book
    I can still turn up the inevitable presentment of the
    Blue Grotto at Capri, and the extremely artificial waterfall
    at Caserta,&mdash;one of the numerous Royal Palaces
    in Italy,&mdash;with its barocco groups of glaring white
    marble placed at the foot of the falls&mdash;Diana and
    her nymphs on the one side, and the ill-treated
    Actæon and his hounds on the other.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p>But the training-ship period was rapidly coming
    to an end, and the autumn of 1872 saw the <i>Ariadne</i> on her way home. She called at Algiers and Gibraltar,
    and finally returned to Portsmouth in October, by
    which time we had all become real midshipmen and
    were only waiting our turn to be appointed to proper
    sea-going ships to commence our real service in the
    British Navy.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1873 I was appointed as midshipman
    to H.M.S. <i>Narcissus</i>, the flagship of a squadron of
    six frigates, and under the command of Rear-Admiral
    Campbell. This squadron consisted of the <i>Narcissus</i>, <i>Doris</i>, <i>Endymion</i>, <i>Aurora</i>, <i>Immortalité</i> and <i>Topaz</i>, and
    was officially known as the Flying Squadron. As
    we were nearly always at sea, generally engaged in
    making long sailing passages, and consequently condemned
    to live a great deal on the ship&rsquo;s provisions,
    the bluejackets bestowed on the squadron the name
    of &ldquo;The Hungry Six,&rdquo; by which designation it was
    usually known in the Service.</p>
<p>There was a galaxy of talent on board the <i>Narcissus</i>.
    The Rear-Admiral, Frederick Campbell, who had
    earned a considerable reputation as a smart officer
    and seaman, had appointed a nephew of his, Charles
    Campbell, as his Flag-Lieutenant, and, to make the
    thing complete and Scottish, one of his servants was
    a piper, who, on guest-nights, used to march round
    the Admiral&rsquo;s table after dinner, according to the
    custom of pipers. Personally, I rather like pipes in
    the distance in Scotland, or when they play with
    troops on the march; but between decks, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> beams were only six feet high, the noise made by
    this solitary specimen of his tribe was enough to wake
    the dead. John Ommaney Hopkins, in after years
    a Lord of the Admiralty and Commander-in-Chief
    of the Mediterranean Fleet, was Flag-Captain, and
    J. R. Fullerton, who afterwards was for so long the
    Admiral of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s Yachts, was Commander.
    In those days he had the well-deserved reputation of
    being one of the very smartest young Commanders
    in the Fleet. Our First-Lieutenant was Lieutenant
    A. K. Wilson, who, later on, earned the V.C. for his
    gallantry when leading his men,&mdash;the men of a machine-gun
    party,&mdash;in the Sudan, and who subsequently
    became the well-known Admiral of the Fleet, Sir
    Arthur Wilson. Another officer of the ship, a perfectly
    undistinguished one, was our Naval Instructor. I
    have forgotten his name, but will call him &ldquo;Mr.
    Smith.&rdquo; Mr. Smith suited the midshipmen perfectly;
    as long as they did not bother him he never bothered
    them, so we strolled in and out during study hours
    at our own sweet wills. One day he announced his
    approaching marriage, and invited all those of us
    that could get leave to the ceremony. We all knew
    his fiancée, for she was the barmaid at a small hotel
    where we youngsters used to foregather when ashore.
    I was one of the fortunate few present at the wedding
    breakfast given by the proprietor of the hotel, whose
    speech, when proposing the health of the happy pair,
    I can never forget, and I recommend it to any
    gentleman who happens to find himself placed in
    the position of orator on similar occasions. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> to this effect: &ldquo;When the courtship began he (the
    hotel proprietor) had rather feared that the whole
    thing would end in a liaison (pronounced ly-a-son),
    but Mr. Smith, to his great surprise and pleasure,
    had behaved honourably and had married the girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after I joined at Plymouth the squadron
    was reported ready for sea, but before starting we
    came in for one of the most furious and sudden gales
    that I can recollect. We were lying in the Sound
    at the time, and I remember I was midshipman of
    the afternoon watch on that Sunday, and though the
    glass was falling ominously the weather was so lovely
    that it did not seem worth while to disturb the ship&rsquo;s
    company, who invariably on Sunday afternoons sleep
    the sleep of the just, there being apparently plenty
    of time to make everything snug for the night later
    on. Suddenly, without any warning, a terrific squall
    struck the ship, and though the water inside the mole
    was perfectly calm, so great was the force of the wind
    that the spray was lifted bodily from the surface of
    the water and became in a moment absolutely blinding,
    and the boats at the boom were in danger of being
    swamped. The hands were at once turned up, the
    boats were hoisted just in time, nearly full of water
    from the spray that had been driven into them. Top-gallant
    masts were struck, two more anchors were
    let go (as we had begun to drag towards Drake&rsquo;s
    Island), steam was got up, and we steamed to our
    anchors almost all the night, during the whole of
    which time the wind was blowing with almost hurricane
    force. In the morning the gale abated, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> one could get some idea of what had been going on.
    One of our consorts, the <i>Aurora</i>, anchored close to
    us, had parted her cable. Luckily, the spare anchors
    brought her up, and she too had been steaming up to
    her anchors all night. In addition to this, there were
    no less than six merchant ships of different sizes ashore
    in the Sound around various parts of the coast.</p>
<p>We left Plymouth shortly afterwards, the West
    Indies being our destination, via the inevitable Madeira.
    On our way out we experienced even worse weather
    than that which I have already described&mdash;worse
    because it lasted so much longer. For a whole week
    the entire squadron was hove-to under storm-sails
    in the Bay, and the <i>Narcissus</i>, though a first-rate sea
    boat and magnificently handled, suffered a good deal.
    She was old and the seams were inclined to open,
    and, moreover, two of the gun ports on the main deck
    were driven in by a heavy sea; consequently she
    shipped so much water that there was hardly a dry
    place in the whole vessel. All this time hammocks
    were never stowed, so the moment our watch was
    over we midshipmen used to turn in, our hammocks
    being the only comparatively dry place to be found.
    We really rather enjoyed this novel condition, as
    though we were constantly employed on deck, seeing
    to the extra security of the guns and a hundred and
    one odds and ends, at any rate school and drill were
    out of the question.</p>
<p>I now have to ask pardon for being tiresomely
    technical, as I must allude to one of the bravest and
    smartest bits of seamanship that I have ever witnessed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> During the height of the gale the outer bobstay carried
    away. The bobstays on the bowsprit of a sailing-ship
    do the duty of supporting that important spar, on the
    safety of which depends the foremast, the main top-mast,
    and hence practically the whole of the great
    fabric of masts and yards. Our First-Lieutenant, the
    A. K. Wilson before alluded to, the boatswain, and
    the captain of the forecastle managed to hang a grating
    under the bowsprit to give them something to stand
    on, and then proceeded to execute the necessary
    repairs. For many hours these three intrepid men
    laboured at this most difficult job, alternately up to
    their necks in water as the bows of the ship plunged
    into the sea, and then high up some fifty feet above it
    when she recovered herself and took her pitch upwards.
    Their labour was rewarded, for the bowsprit was saved,
    and one likes to remember what a mere matter of
    course it was considered in those non-advertising days.
    In more modern times one has seen brass bands and
    local mayors meeting the heroes of far less dangerous
    and difficult exploits, after the necessary &ldquo;boom&rdquo; has
    been judiciously engineered.</p>
<p>During the gale the squadron was dispersed and lost
    all knowledge of each other. However, the rendezvous
    had been given as Vigo, and at Vigo we all eventually
    turned up, and from thence proceeded to Madeira.</p>
<p>And now to say something about the life of a
    midshipman in those days. We had,&mdash;besides a good
    deal of so-called study which was imparted to us by a
    naval instructor, and a considerable amount of drill,&mdash;to
    keep regular watch in four reliefs; the only time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> we ever ceased to keep watch was on being put in
    charge of a boat in harbour. To be in charge of a
    boat was considered rather an honour. Steam launches
    were rare,&mdash;even a large frigate carried only one, and
    that one merely an ordinary pulling boat with a small
    rattletrap engine bolted into it, the maximum speed
    being about six knots,&mdash;so practically all the boat-work
    of a ship was done under oars and under sail, and
    great fun it was. But the really important business
    was, of course, the sail-drill, ship against ship, that took
    place every evening when at sea, and to a limited
    extent twice a day in harbour. There was a terrific
    competition of the most jealous nature; the upper
    yardmen, upon whose smartness it mainly depended,
    used to carry their jealousy so far as to pick quarrels
    with their principal opponents directly they got ashore
    together. For the sake of general peace and quietness,
    and the comfort of the local police, it eventually
    became necessary to give certain ships&rsquo; companies leave
    on different days, to prevent the eternal battles they
    used to fight on shore where there was no discipline
    to restrain them.</p>
<p>A sailing cruise round the West Indies sounds extremely
    like a yachting excursion, but, in absolute fact,
    a journey performed by a squadron of sailing frigates
    keeping meticulous station under sail, and sometimes
    having to make short tacks every five minutes or so, to
    come into their anchorage, and all this in tropical
    heat, does not seem to have much of the yacht
    connected with it.</p>
<p>The days and months passed by quickly enough, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> in somewhat monotonous fashion, until the spring of
    1874, when we were ordered to reinforce the Mediterranean
    Fleet, then under the command of Admiral Sir
    Hastings Yelverton. Sir Hastings was then flying
    his flag on board the <i>Lord Warden</i>, one of our very
    early iron-clads. She really merited the name of iron-clad,
    for she was a wooden ship with wrought-iron
    plates bolted on to her. Sir Hastings was himself
    quite one of the best specimens of the great sea
    officer of those days. A very fine gentleman, with a
    thorough knowledge of the world, he was an invaluable
    servant to his country at that particular moment,
    as Spain was in a state of semi-revolution, and it was
    fortunate for England that the Commander-in-Chief
    united in his person all the best characteristics of the
    diplomatist, the man of the world, and the sailor. The
    trouble began from the Naval point of view, when the
    Revolutionary party seized two Spanish men-of-war
    of considerable size and importance, the <i>Vittoria</i> and <i>Almanza</i>, and started on what was probably going to
    be a piratical cruise in foreign waters. The British
    Navy, amongst its other numerous duties, has always
    been busy in the suppression of piracy, so that in a
    very few days the <i>Vittoria</i> and <i>Almanza</i> were duly
    rounded up, the crews landed, and the ships themselves
    safely interned at Gibraltar. The next move of
    the Intransigentes,&mdash;as the revolutionary party called
    themselves,&mdash;was to seize the forts that commanded
    the arsenal of Carthagena, and they then took possession
    of the greater part of the Spanish Fleet. Our
    Mediterranean Fleet promptly went to Carthagena and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> the neighbouring ports on the east coast of Spain to
    watch the course of events. Being short of funds, the
    Intransigentes conceived the idea of cruising down
    their own coast, sticking to territorial waters, and
    demanding money from all the towns along the coast.
    In case of refusal the towns were to be bombarded. In
    the interest of humanity the English Fleet used to
    hover round and place themselves between the Intransigente
    Fleet and the shore, and insist on forty-eight
    hours&rsquo; grace being given to enable the women and
    children to be removed to a place of safety. The
    local Carthagenan butcher, who, I think, was for the
    moment the Intransigente admiral, was given to understand
    that unless he complied with the request of the
    British admiral, he and his squadron would, in all
    probability, be blown sky high. Being a sensible man,
    he did as he was told, but, occasionally, after the
    necessary interval on which we had insisted had expired,
    a bombardment would take place. I was present
    at one, and enjoyed the spectacle most thoroughly.
    Alicante was the town in question. In the way of
    defence it possessed a charming old sixteenth-century
    citadel, as well as two or three little batteries on the
    beach that could just manage to return a salute. None
    the less, the Governor of Alicante, on being asked
    &ldquo;for his money or his life,&rdquo; with true Spanish chivalry,
    firmly declined to pay any sort of ransom, manned his
    little popguns, and prepared for the worst. We, as
    usual, were anchored between the town and the Intransigente
    squadron, and after the forty-eight hours&rsquo;
    interval had come to an end we retired like &ldquo;seconds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> out of the ring,&rdquo; purposely taking as long as possible
    over this necessary man&#339;uvre. Then the fun began.
    The Intransigentes, some of whose ships were very
    heavily armoured for those days (they carried 9-inch
    guns, which really were 240-pounders), began to
    bombard, and the citadel and batteries returned the
    fire. At that time I was midshipman of the foretop,
    so up there I ensconced myself, and a splendid view
    I got of the whole proceedings. It was a deliciously
    comic performance. The Intransigente shooting was
    so bad that the proverbial haystack would have been
    quite safe. Indeed, as we saw later when we landed,
    they could not even hit a town, and barring a few
    broken windows there was no harm done at all, and no
    casualties. The shore defenders meanwhile fired little
    round shots that went skipping along the top of the
    water until they were tired and sank. It is needless
    to remark that had they actually hit one of the iron-clad
    vessels at which they were directed, they would
    have had no more effect than the classical patting of
    the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s would have had on the Dean
    and Chapter. After a few hours of this performance,
    the Intransigentes wearied of it and went on to some
    other coast town to try their luck there, shadowed by
    another portion of Sir Hastings&rsquo; fleet. The captain of
    the foretop, who was a great friend of mine, was much
    looked up to by his top mates as a sort of encyclopædia
    of knowledge of all sorts, so I was much amused
    to hear the following conversation, which, of course,
    was not intended for my chaste ears, while I was
    looking through my spy-glass at the bombardment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> The captain of the foretop was being interrogated:
    &ldquo;Bill, &rsquo;oo is that there &rsquo;ere Queen of Spain at all?&rdquo;
    Bill replied: &ldquo;The Queen, she&rsquo;s a . . .&rdquo; and then
    followed a string of lurid adjectives, leading up to the
    suggestion that the royal lady in question belonged to
    what Rudyard Kipling calls the oldest profession in
    the world.</p>
<p>I did not see much more of the Intransigente Fleet,
    but not long afterwards it brought its cruising to an
    inglorious end. The Spaniards succeeded in getting
    together a few loyal ships under a real admiral, as a
    means of putting an end to this potential piracy. Just
    before the expected general engagement could take
    place, the Intransigente admiral,&mdash;who, though doubtless
    he may have known a great deal about bullocks
    and sheep, was woefully deficient in knowledge of fleet
    man&#339;uvring,&mdash;succeeded in ramming and sinking one
    of his own squadron. This untoward incident upset
    his nerve and that of his companions to such an extent
    that the whole of his fleet ignominiously surrendered.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Intransigente episode considerable
    changes were made in the personnel of the senior
    officers of the <i>Narcissus</i>. Rear-Admiral Campbell
    hauled down his flag and was succeeded by Rear-Admiral
    Randolph, the Captain and Commander were
    relieved, and our First-Lieutenant was about the same
    time promoted to the rank of Commander and left us.
    With the exception of the ship&rsquo;s company and junior
    officers, the <i>Narcissus</i> had become almost a new ship,
    and of course there was the usual grousing that
    always takes place on these occasions among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> junior officers. To our experienced minds nothing
    that was new <i>could</i> be right, and I must confess that so
    far as efficient seamanship and smartness aloft were concerned,
    the old lot could hardly have been improved on.
    The squadron remained in the Mediterranean, but was
    no longer closely attached to the Commander-in-Chief,
    and went eastward for a cruise in the Levant.</p>
<p>Amongst other ports visited was Smyrna, and there
    a couple of my messmates and I got into rather considerable
    trouble. The Consul at Smyrna had arranged
    a special train to give the Admiral and Officers
    of the squadron a chance of visiting Ephesus, where
    a number of archæologists were then busy excavating
    the celebrated Temple of Diana. We, in our
    wisdom, thought it would be dull work going up with
    a number of officers, most of whom would be our
    seniors as the companions of this excursion, so having
    hired horses, we slipped away early in the morning and
    proceeded to ride some thirty miles up country to
    Ephesus. Of course we never dreamt of bothering
    about a guide or any detail of that kind, but somehow
    or another midshipmen generally manage to turn up at
    their destination, and after a delightful ride over a fine
    grass country, we arrived all right. Meanwhile,
    unfortunately for us, the Flag-Lieutenant had, in a
    casual way, mentioned to the Admiral at breakfast
    that three of the youngsters had started to ride up.
    The Admiral had been previously warned by the
    Consul that the country outside Smyrna is infested
    with brigands, and on account of the bother that it
    would have given him had anything happened to us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> he was full of wrath, which was eventually to descend
    on our innocent heads. Orders were at once sent
    ashore to the Consul to inform the Turkish Governor,
    and altogether such a fuss was made that eventually a
    squadron of Turkish cavalry was sent out to get hold
    of us and bring us back. By this time we had about
    three hours&rsquo; start, and as, probably, from what I know
    of Turks, the Cavalry did not hurry over much, they
    never got near us. None the less, when we arrived
    at Ephesus our troubles began. We were looking
    about for some place to put up and feed our horses,
    preparatory to feeding ourselves in view of our ride
    back, when we happened unluckily to meet the Flag-Captain,
    who got into what we thought a most unnecessary
    state of rage, and ordered us at once to
    get into the train and go back in that comparatively
    undignified conveyance to Smyrna, then to go straight
    on board the ship, and report ourselves as prisoners
    under close arrest. This was a bore of course,
    but with my usual philosophy I consoled myself with
    the reflection that, as a prisoner, I should not have
    to keep any watch that night, and would have a
    good night in, which would be infinitely preferable to
    walking the deck for four hours after a long outing.
    The first part of the programme was carried out all
    right, but, to my disgust, when I tried to excuse
    myself for not going on duty, pleading that, as a
    prisoner, I was incapable of doing duty, the Commander
    calmly informed me that I was temporarily released, so
    on watch I had to go.</p>
<p>Our arrest lasted about a month and came to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> end very unexpectedly. Somehow or other (we youngsters,
    who were naturally the severest of critics, all
    thought from very faulty seamanship) the <i>Narcissus</i> and
    another ship of the squadron took the ground rather
    badly off the coast of Sicily. Of course there was a
    Court-martial, and to our intense delight our Captain
    was dismissed his ship and our arrest came to a
    triumphant conclusion. With the usual pitilessness
    of youth, we looked upon it as a judgment upon our
    superior officer, and to round the episode off nicely, I,
    having been just relieved from watch when the ship
    went aground, was one of the witnesses at the Court-martial.
    I am ashamed to say that our delight when
    the sentence was promulgated was scarcely, to say the
    least of it, decent, and when the unfortunate Captain
    returned on board to turn over his command to an
    acting successor who was at once appointed, he must
    have almost heard the uproarious cheering in the
    midshipmen&rsquo;s berth. What brutes boys are!</p>
<p>Nothing particularly exciting happened during the
    rest of my time in the <i>Narcissus</i>. She was paid off in
    the summer of 1874 on her return to England, and I
    managed to get some leave whilst waiting for an
    appointment to a new ship.</p>
<p>In August 1874 the appointment came, and the
    &ldquo;new ship&rdquo; turned out to be the <i>Audacious</i>, fitted out
    at Chatham as the flagship of Vice-Admiral Ryder, a
    distant connection of my own, who had been appointed
    to the command of the China Station.</p>
<p>The <i>Audacious</i> and her sister ships, one of which was
    the <i>Vanguard</i> which was sunk later by another sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> the <i>Iron Duke</i>, in a collision in the Channel, were a type
    of middle-sized battleships evolved about that period
    by the Chief Constructor of the Navy and his Naval
    Advisors at the Admiralty. I have seen some fairly
    useless types of vessels produced in my time, but
    really the &ldquo;Audacious&rdquo; type was almost unique in that
    way. Fairly heavily masted and barque rigged, the <i>Audacious</i> could not even sail with a fair wind, for it
    was impossible to steer her unless the engines were
    kept going. With considerable horse-power her full
    trial speed was barely twelve knots; indeed I do not
    think that in the whole of her career, which was a long
    one, she could ever really do ten knots for six consecutive
    hours. The main armament consisted of
    9-inch muzzle-loading guns. These guns were very
    much on the same lines as the modern howitzer as far
    as length was concerned. This type of weapon had
    such a high trajectory that it was practically useless
    unless the range was known within 100 yards, an
    almost impossible condition at sea. They were mounted
    on what was known as the Box Battery System&mdash;a
    name that described the battery so well that any further
    explanation is superfluous, and, as the name implies, the
    whole formed the most perfect shell-trap that could be
    conceived by the ingenuity of man. There is always
    a reason for everything, and there was some sort of
    reason for the &ldquo;Audacious&rdquo; class. The Navy in the
    early &rsquo;seventies was mad on the subject of ramming.
    The lesson was, of course, learnt from what had
    occurred at Lissa, but probably it was terribly over-applied.
    There was a consequent craze for what were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> supposed to be short, handy ships, and that was where
    the failure of the system came in. They were short,
    but they were never handy, for shortness can never
    make up for the consequent loss of speed and bad
    steering. However, having served for nearly four
    years in sailing frigates, I was duly impressed by the
    size and magnificence of this new monster of the
    ocean. It was only by experience that we learnt what
    an appallingly bad ship ours was, even as compared
    with already existing types.</p>
<p>I must now say something about the superior officers.
    Admiral Ryder had the reputation of being an extremely
    erudite and scientific officer, so naturally we midshipmen
    distrusted him instinctively. I saw a great deal of him
    later on, and a kinder and more amiable old gentleman
    never lived. Captain Philip Colomb was his Flag-Captain.
    He, at any rate, was a very able man, and,
    far in advance of his time, was one of the earliest
    advocates of the abolition of masts and yards, as being
    useless appendages and a danger in action. How
    right he was we know by our modern Navy; and the
    experience he was about to acquire,&mdash;I allude to what
    I have already written about the sailing qualities of the <i>Audacious</i>,&mdash;could only have confirmed his judgment.
    Our Commander was the present Admiral Sir Cyprian
    Bridge, so&mdash;as in the <i>Narcissus</i> (though of a totally
    different stamp),&mdash;I was again fortunate enough to be
    serving under a very distinguished group of officers.
    Two or three of the midshipmen in the <i>Audacious</i> had
    been in the <i>Narcissus</i> before, and it is needless to
    relate how convinced we were that, as seamen, we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> sure to compare very favourably with the poor
    unfortunates who had only had experience of life at
    sea in what we irreverently called a tin pot.</p>
<p>Chatham was a foul locality in those days, and, for
    all I know, may still be unattractive. The only incident
    I remember well, however, was the excitement in the
    Dockyard when the then Princess of Wales, in the
    heyday of her exquisite beauty, came down to christen
    her godchild, the <i>Alexandra</i>, which was launched about
    that time. Soon after this the <i>Audacious</i> sailed for her
    Station, and we began to realise what we were in for in
    our new ship. One good point she certainly had.
    Owing to a variety of reasons, at sea she was as steady
    as the proverbial rock. There were reports current
    that this steadiness was the result of carrying all the
    principal weights,&mdash;guns, armour, spars, etc.,&mdash;abnormally
    high. However, the Constructor&rsquo;s Department,
    by means of all sorts of figures (and of course figures
    cannot lie), clearly proved that she was, if possible,
    unnecessarily safe; but, anyhow, as we midshipmen
    knew nothing about angles of safety, and cared still less,
    we greatly appreciated the fact of her steadiness. Her
    other good point was that she was high between decks,
    which made the gunroom mess a little more habitable,
    and gave us more air when tucked up in our hammocks
    at night, as compared with the old-fashioned frigate
    barely 6 feet high at the beams.</p>
<p>We were directed to proceed to China through
    the Mediterranean, passing through the Suez Canal,
    although it was considered doubtful whether a ship of
    the size of the <i>Audacious</i> could get through the Canal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> as it then was. And, indeed, it was a job of some
    dimensions! On arrival at Port Said the ship was
    lightened of all the coal and stores that we could spare
    and we proceeded on our course through the Canal,
    provided with one tug ahead and two tugs astern, to
    keep her straight. Anything less straight than our
    course it is difficult to imagine. In spite of the tugs
    we bumped about merrily from one bank to the other,
    our bluff bows making such a wave that the whole
    countryside was flooded. Surely, since the <i>Argo</i> first took the sea, there never was such a brute
    to steer as H.M.S. <i>Audacious</i>! After two days&rsquo;
    bumping about in the Canal we reached Suez, and
    from Aden, our next port of call, we proceeded to
    Galle in Ceylon.</p>
<p>To cross the Indian Ocean from Aden to Point de
    Galle, a distance of only 3000 miles, took us about
    thirty days. The most economical speed of our species
    of Noah&rsquo;s Ark turned out to be well under five knots
    an hour, and though we had filled up one of the large
    flats below the battery with coal, and carried a deck
    cargo into the bargain, it was all we could do to crawl
    into Galle before we came to the end of our tether.
    Do not let it be imagined that all the ships built about
    that period were the same hopeless failures. Far from
    it. Many of our early battleships and cruisers were
    fine specimens of naval architecture and steamed quite
    well. Some of the cruisers could sail as well as
    steam extremely well. The &ldquo;Audacious&rdquo; class, as
    before explained, was simply the outcome of the &ldquo;short,
    handy ship&rdquo; theory carried out to the verge of lunacy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<p>From Galle we wended our way in the same leisurely
    fashion to Singapore, and arrived there about Christmas
    time. Singapore was practically the southern limit of the
    China Station, and there our Admiral and Commander-in-Chief
    saw the first of his command. The China
    Station was then practically divided into three portions:
    the southern based upon Singapore; North China,
    based upon Shanghai; whilst the ships stationed in
    Japan lay for the most part at Yokohama. Hong
    Kong was the main headquarters of the Station, and
    the Commodore flew his broad pennant from the masthead
    of an old line-of-battleship, the <i>Victor Emanuel</i>,
    which, doing duty as guardship and receiving-ship, was
    in the same category as the previously described <i>Duke
    of Wellington</i> at Portsmouth. The Commodore was
    also superintendent of the Dockyard. Each of the
    three districts,&mdash;if one may apply such a term as district
    to the sea,&mdash;was looked after by the senior officer in the
    shape of a captain commanding a corvette, having under
    him a string of gun-vessels and gunboats. It was a
    great station for small craft. These were necessary
    because they could go a considerable distance up the
    great rivers of China, for some of them would spend the
    best part of three years up the same river, only varied
    by an occasional visit to Hong Kong for a refit. The
    flagship herself had a sort of roving commission, and
    when things were quiet her presence on different parts
    of the Station became a question of climate, which
    usually meant Japan for the summer and South China
    for the winter. As may readily be imagined, to serve
    in a flagship on the China Station was one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> pleasantest jobs that came a sailor&rsquo;s way, and I, for one,
    passed two very happy years there.</p>
<p>It was at Singapore that I met, for the first time, a
    man of whom I was destined to see a great deal many
    years afterwards,&mdash;Sir Frank Swettenham,&mdash;then at the
    commencement of his long and successful career in the
    Straits Settlements and Malay States, a career which
    only came to an end with the termination of his
    Governorship in 1904. I forget exactly what his post
    was during the winter of 1874-75, but I have the
    happiest recollection of dining at a bungalow which he
    shared with a distant cousin of mine, one of the Herveys,
    who was then a Civil Servant at Singapore. Fancy
    how great a delight it was to a midshipman to get out
    of the gunroom,&mdash;which in hot weather was rather
    like a heated sardine tin,&mdash;and instead of eating the
    usual horrible food which was our daily fare, to <i>dine</i> in
    the best sense of that important word. I may, parenthetically,
    remark that I have always taken the greatest
    interest in food; that is to say, whenever I have had the
    opportunity, for when attached to an Army in the Field,
    or, worse still, living in a naval mess, it is useless to
    bother about anything from a culinary point of view,
    beyond the elemental fact of eating to keep oneself
    alive. There are many things that are good to eat
    in this world, and, in their turn, I have appreciated
    the <i>cuisine bourgeoise</i> of Provence and Gascony, the
    numerous <i>pasta</i> dishes of Italy, to say nothing of
    the supreme efforts of quite a large quantity of the
    great chefs of Paris, but I still think the one thing
    very difficult to beat in the way of a delicacy is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> the genuine Malay vegetable curry eaten in its own
    home, with which every dinner, and indeed every meal,
    in that part of the world, is invariably topped-up.
    Moreover, the setting was so pleasant:&mdash;The verandah
    of a bungalow, with a tropical moon so luminous that
    candles were hardly needed, with the murmur of the
    jungle in one&rsquo;s ears, and, in place of the eternal &ldquo;shop&rdquo;
    which becomes one&rsquo;s portion in the gunroom, to enjoy
    the conversation of two extremely agreeable men, one
    of whom was certainly a remarkably able one into the
    bargain. The cynical mind may suggest that as likely
    as not the agreeable men in question were talking their
    own &ldquo;shop&rdquo; most of the time. Perhaps it may have
    been so; at any rate it was a new &ldquo;shop&rdquo; to me.</p>
<p>Our next move was to Hong Kong; for the <i>Audacious</i>,
    quite a long sea-trip, with the accompanying difficulties
    which I have already described. These were partially
    overcome by calling at Saigon, the Headquarters of
    the French Navy in those waters. The Commander-in-Chief
    was there able to kill two birds with one stone&mdash;to
    exchange courtesies with the French Commander-in-Chief
    and take in a fresh supply of coal for the remainder
    of his journey. It is quite unnecessary to describe
    Saigon. Claude Farrère, who, though a sailor, is also a
    great writer, has done it already in the most masterly
    fashion in <i>Les Civilisés</i>. Even a few days of the
    climate of Saigon, which resembles nothing in the world
    so much as the interior of an orchid house, are trying
    enough. Small wonder that the unfortunate Government
    officials and naval officers who are out there for
    years take to opium smoking and various other weird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> amusements&mdash;in fact, anything&mdash;to while the time
    away.</p>
<p>We finally arrived at our destination,&mdash;Hong Kong,&mdash;after
    about a five months&rsquo; journey from England, and
    there we spent some considerable time refitting and preparing
    for our summer cruise. During our stay there I
    had finished serving my time as a midshipman, having
    completed four and a half years, and passed my examination,
    so far as seamanship was concerned, for sub-lieutenant.
    I was fortunate enough to be given a first-class,
    and on the strength of it could have claimed a passage
    home to pass the other two examinations in gunnery and
    navigation which were necessary to confirm me in my
    rank. Until these were passed one could only hold
    the rank of Acting Sub-Lieutenant. Of course I ought
    to have done so, for, had I taken the other two first-classes,&mdash;and,
    barring accidents, there was not much
    difficulty in doing so,&mdash;I should have been made a
    Lieutenant at once. Unfortunately there were attractions
    of various kinds at Hong Kong, and I am afraid
    I succumbed to them all. The result was I remained
    out there for over another year having a very pleasant
    time, but steadily losing seniority. Nevertheless, the
    year in the Far East was really well spent even at
    the expense of spoiling what might possibly have been
    a successful career in the Navy. To see something
    of China,&mdash;to my mind by far the most interesting
    country in the world,&mdash;to see the beginning of
    the Europeanising of Japan, is a pleasanter thing
    to look back upon than the possibilities of high
    command in various parts of the world, finishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> off, at its very best, with the command of a Home
    Port.</p>
<p>Shortly after I had attained to the exalted rank of
    Acting Sub-Lieutenant, a vacancy occurred owing to
    the sudden death of a Commander of one of the gun-vessels,
    and, as was always the case in those days, the
    acting vacancy was given to the Flag-Lieutenant. The
    Admiral very kindly made me his Acting Flag-Lieutenant
    for the time being, so that, at the age of a
    little over nineteen, I found myself on the Staff of a
    Commander-in-Chief. The result of my temporary
    promotion was that I was suddenly thrown into the
    vortex of Hong Kong Society, about which it is necessary
    to say something. Naturally, the head of the whole
    business was the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Arthur
    Kennedy. The honours of Government House were
    done by his daughter, Miss Kennedy, in the most
    charming fashion, and many were the pleasant dinners
    I enjoyed at that hospitable table. Miss Kennedy
    subsequently married the late Admiral of the Fleet,
    Lord Clanwilliam, but that was later, and after her
    father had left the Colony. The next in rank to the
    Governor was the Naval Commander-in-Chief, and the
    General in Command of Troops, Captains of ships and
    Colonels of regiments, all came along in the usual
    official way. All this was obvious enough and not in
    the least amusing, but what delighted me was the table of
    precedence of those whom we youngsters always talked
    of as &ldquo;dollar grinders,&rdquo; who, with their wives, were in
    real life the representatives of the great firms of China
    Merchants. I had to make myself acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> these terrible rules of precedence so as not to make an
    unnecessary number of mistakes on the occasions when
    my Admiral was entertaining the rank and fashion of
    Hong Kong. They were rather a terrifying lot, these
    same wives of dollar grinders, and used to fight like cats
    if not put in their proper places. The whole precedence
    was based on the importance, or supposed importance,
    of the firm, and in my time Jardine &amp; Mathieson
    were an easy first; consequently the wife of that firm&rsquo;s
    representative was in the prime position of being the
    leading civilian lady of the Colony. But even in 1875
    the importance of the China Merchant was beginning
    to dwindle, and small wonder! The youngsters who
    used to go out as tea-tasters were started on a salary of
    £400 a year. Admirable board was provided for them
    by the firm at what was called the Hong, where they
    not only had the best of messing provided for them
    gratis, but, in addition, could ask as many guests as
    they liked. Moreover, to make the thing complete,
    the firm provided them with a chair and two coolies to
    carry them about. (We have not yet heard of runners
    on the Stock Exchange being accommodated by their
    employers with free taxi cabs!) Being for the most
    part very little more than schoolboys, they naturally had
    a very good time. There were rumours that they
    had a certain amount of work to do in the morning;
    but even this was never confirmed. Anyhow, after a
    remarkably copious &ldquo;tiffin&rdquo; and the necessary hour&rsquo;s
    rest, the real business of the day began, such as the
    training of racing ponies, cricket, rowing, and every sort
    of sport that was then popular. If nothing better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> offered, the Hong provided an excellent dinner, and
    then everybody adjourned to the Club for cards,
    billiards or bowls until the small hours. Meanwhile,
    the German merchants,&mdash;to say nothing of the indigenous
    Chinese,&mdash;were gradually ousting the Englishman.
    Even at the unreflective age of nineteen it struck me
    that, as a business proposition, the German clerk who
    worked all day, spoke at least four languages and kept
    himself on £80 a year, would be apt to further the
    interest of his firm and be more generally useful to it
    than our own young men, who lived luxuriously,
    amused themselves a good deal, spoke no language but
    their own, and probably cost the firm not far short of
    £1000 a year apiece.</p>
<p>But to return to the Society aspect:&mdash;I remember
    well the first dinner to which I accompanied my
    Admiral, given at East Point by the then representative
    of Jardine &amp; Mathieson. After the complete dinner
    party had filed in arm in arm, strictly in accordance with
    the precedence of the firms, I wandered in humbly,
    last and alone. However, I reflected, while I was
    philosophically consoling myself with the pleasures of
    the table, which included remarkably good wine, that
    had I been there in my real rank as an Acting Sub-Lieutenant,
    I should probably have been sent to dine in
    the steward&rsquo;s room instead.</p>
<p>The drawback to Hong Kong, as the Headquarters
    of the China Station, was that it was a terribly
    expensive place, and as a system of universal credit
    obtained, it was really difficult for young officers to
    resist the temptation of running into debt. A certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> number certainly did come to grief, and the only
    wonder is that there were not more of them. The
    British public is beginning to realise at last how
    miserable a pittance is the pay of the Naval Officer of
    to-day. In my young days it was a great deal worse,
    and in China we were literally defrauded by the
    Admiralty into the bargain. It is a disgraceful fact
    that the officers and men were paid monthly in silver
    dollars valued by the Government at what used to be the
    par value of the dollar, namely 4<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>; when their real
    value was well under 4<i>s.</i> Of course this did not affect
    the higher ranks; on the contrary, it suited them
    admirably. They could get their cheques cashed at
    the bank on shore, and instead of taking their dollars
    could remit not only their pay but, up to a decent
    point, a good deal besides at 4<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> and make a very fine
    profit; but as far as the unfortunate junior officers
    (who had no banking accounts) and the ship&rsquo;s company
    were concerned, it was nothing else than highway
    robbery. But from time immemorial, the officers and
    men serving afloat and doing the real work of the
    Navy have been robbed by the civilian side of the
    Admiralty. Readers of history will remember the great
    Dundonald&rsquo;s crusade, when he was Captain Lord Cochrane,
    against the Malta Prize Court, and his subsequent
    exposure of similar scandals in the House of Commons.
    All the scandals then exposed must necessarily have
    been within the knowledge of the Admiralty of those
    days, who either connived at it or shared in the plunder.
    Two of the cases quoted by Dundonald in the House
    of Commons are worth repeating:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;The noble lord then read a letter from a captain of a vessel
        at the Cape of Good Hope, complaining &lsquo;that the officers of ships
        of war were so pillaged by those of the Vice-Admiralty Courts,
        that he wished to know how they could be relieved; whether they
        could be allowed the liberty to send their prizes home, and how far
        the jurisdiction of the Vice-Admiralty Court extended; for that
        the charges of Court were so exorbitant, it required the whole
        amount of the value of a good prize to satisfy them. In the
        case of one vessel that was sold for 11,000 rupees, the charges
        amounted to more than 10,000. This was the case at Penang,
        Malacca, and other places, as well as at the Cape.&rsquo;</p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>&ldquo;The noble lord said he had produced the copy of the bill
        to show the length of it. He then showed the original; and
        to show the equity and moderation of the Vice-Admiralty
        Court, he read one article where, on the taxation of a bill, the
        Court, for deducting fifty crowns, charged thirty-five crowns
        for the trouble in doing it. A vessel was valued at 8,608
        crowns, the Marshal received one per cent, for delivering her,
        and in the end the net proceeds amounted to no more than
        1,900 crowns out of 8,608&mdash;all the rest had been embezzled
        and swallowed up in the Prize Court. He was sorry, he said,
        to trepass on the time of the House, on a day when another
        matter of importance was to come before them. He pledged
        himself, however, that no subject could be introduced more
        highly deserving their serious attention and consideration.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The public have not yet heard all that is going to be
    done in the case of the prize money earned by the
    Navy during the late war. For the sake of my old
    comrades and their successors I hope that those who
    have gone through and survived the wear and tear and
    exhaustion of those terrible four and a half years will
    not be fleeced of their just due as were their great-grandfathers.</p>
<p>But to return to Hong Kong. It was obviously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> difficult for very insufficiently paid young men to
    resist living like others of their own age, regardless
    of the fact that those others were much better off.
    I remember the instance of two brothers, one a
    sub-lieutenant in a gunboat and the other a subaltern
    in the Royal Engineers. There was only a year&rsquo;s
    difference in age between them. The sub-lieutenant
    in the Navy received £90 a year, subject to the illegal
    tax already mentioned; the subaltern R.E., what with
    colonial pay and allowances and an extra £1 a day from
    the Colony as Surveyor of Roads, made up just £900
    a year. Further comment is unnecessary. The
    system of credit already alluded to needs mention,
    for at that time both in the Crown Colonies and also
    in the Treaty Ports of China no money other than
    copper was in general circulation, and this was not on
    account of any lack of silver but owing to a Chinese
    peculiarity. The Chinaman is, I believe, considered
    by all those doing business with him to be the most
    honest and trustworthy trader in the world; dealing
    on a large scale with a Chinaman it was always said
    that no signature would be necessary, the Chinaman&rsquo;s
    word being as good as his bond. On the other hand,
    the lower class Chinaman could never resist helping
    himself to a tiny slice off any silver dollar that came
    into his hands. The result was that after a short time
    the dollars in circulation lost so seriously in value that
    they could not be accepted at their face value, and
    earned for themselves the sobriquet of &ldquo;chop dollars.&rdquo;
    Hence dollars, except at the end of the month, were
    never seen, and the only cash ever carried were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> few coppers necessary to pay for the chair which did
    the work of the then hansom in London. The &ldquo;chit&rdquo;
    system was universal; whether it was dinner at the
    club, a cocktail at the bar, or a hair-cut at the very
    smart hairdresser&rsquo;s shop on the Bund. All that was
    necessary was to sign for the amount. It was hardly
    to be wondered at if we boys were on the verge of
    bankruptcy every month.</p>
<p>Sometimes, alas! it was worse than bankruptcy. I
    am rather ashamed, even now, when I remember
    that I helped a brother officer, who turned out to
    be a real rogue, to escape. He was a paymaster on
    one of the small craft on the Station. He had
    been put under close arrest by Admiralty order as
    an irregularity had been discovered in his accounts
    when submitted home. Three or four of us young
    idiots firmly believed in his version, namely that
    not a halfpenny was really missing or had ever got
    into his pocket. He admitted having been careless
    and said it would be impossible for him to prove
    his innocence at the Court-martial (this part of the
    story was remarkably true!), and consequently he
    would be sure to be sentenced to imprisonment. He
    was very popular with his brother officers, and also
    (alas, for his sake!) with a great many of the light-hearted
    division ashore. The upshot of it was that
    we, at the risk of our own necks (for had anything
    leaked out we must have been tried by Court-martial
    and dismissed the Service at the least) assisted him to
    escape. We procured a boat in the dead of night,
    manning it ourselves, squared the sentry over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> cabin door to look the other way when the prisoner
    went on deck; he then succeeded in creeping over the
    bows while the officer of the watch was aft, and got into
    the boat from which he was pulled on board a steamer
    bound for San Francisco. And that was the last we
    heard of him. The only two incidents connected with
    this story that give me any pleasure on looking back,
    are that I, who was rather behind the scenes, knew that
    the trouble originated as the Frenchmen say all trouble
    originates. It was a case of <i>cherchez la femme</i>, and
    that knowledge pleases my sense of philosophy; while
    my sense of humour is tickled by the fact that the
    sentry&rsquo;s bribe for looking the other way was a bottle
    of rum!</p>
<p>In the summer of 1875 there was a rising of the
    natives in Perak, which, assuming serious proportions,
    eventually culminated into one of our many
    little wars. On board the Flagship we were all in
    a great state of excitement, feeling convinced that the
    Commander-in-Chief would at once proceed to the
    scene of action with every available ship and land a
    Naval Brigade, and that, consequently, war service and
    medals, and, what was more important still, promotion
    would be coming our way. As Acting Flag-Lieutenant
    I would not have changed places with any one in the
    world, and had rosy visions of being the youngest
    Commander in the Service. Alas! those rosy visions
    were never even to get to the fading stage. The
    Commander-in-Chief, instead of proceeding to the
    south, breathing fire and flame, as we all hoped he
    would, calmly went in the other direction, namely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> to Shanghai and Japan, and left the Senior Officer,
    Captain Alexander Buller, commanding the corvette <i>Modeste</i>, to deal with the situation and reap the
    rewards. We junior officers never forgave the &ldquo;old
    man,&rdquo; as we called him; but I dare say he was perfectly
    right,&mdash;for all any of us knew there might have been
    excellent reasons for keeping the central and northern
    part of our forces intact. Indeed, I strongly suspect
    that our Legation at Pekin had a considerable say
    in the matter from what I saw in North China
    later.</p>
<p>Whilst on the Admiral&rsquo;s Staff I came in for a most
    interesting visit to Canton. The flag was shifted to
    the <i>Vigilant</i>, a small paddle-boat yacht that was part
    of the establishment of the Commander-in-Chief in
    China, and a very necessary part, as it enabled him
    to go up and inspect his gunboats, many of which
    were perpetually stationed up the various rivers, in the
    never-ceasing work of the Navy, namely the protection
    of British interests. I was naturally in attendance
    on my Chief when he paid his official calls on the
    mandarins whom it was necessary for him to visit, and
    interesting it was to be carried in palanquins through
    the narrow streets of Canton, and finally to penetrate
    into the courtyards of the various <i>yamens</i> where
    these mandarins lived and had their being. Unfortunately
    I was too young and ignorant then to appreciate
    things fully, and never took in the beauty of the
    artistic treasures I had this chance of seeing; in fact,
    the only outstanding impression that was left on my
    mind by Canton was one of amazement that anybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> could keep alive in the city for long, in such an
    atmosphere of heat and stink!</p>
<p>The <i>Vigilant</i> remained one night up the river, and
    of course our cicerones, the English residents, insisted
    on taking us to visit the flower boats, which were
    curious enough in their way. To the Western mind,
    the painting of the women&rsquo;s faces seemed rather overdone,
    and gilded lips, one thought at the time, were
    perhaps a shade too artificial. Nowadays, I suppose
    it would scarcely be noticed, since our own women
    have taken to raddling themselves with paint to quite
    an Oriental extent, and really the difference between
    the eternal blob of carmine that one sees on the lips of
    every woman in London and the gilded mouth of the
    Eastern women is almost negligible.</p>
<p>Shortly after the commencement of the Perak Campaign,
    the <i>Audacious</i> left for Shanghai <i>en route</i> for
    a summer in Japan. During my service on the China
    Station, which lasted about two years, the <i>Audacious</i> was several times at Shanghai, and a very pleasant
    place it was. The magnificence of the dollar grinder
    of that port overshadowed that of his counterpart in
    Hong Kong in every way, the Club was far better
    and the racing on a bigger scale. Huge sums would
    be given for racing ponies, meaning that big money
    could be won in stakes and selling lotteries, were the
    animal only good enough. I remember one pony that
    fetched as much as 2000 taels, the equivalent of
    about £700 English,&mdash;a long price for a pony of barely
    fourteen hands. The other sport indulged in by the
    people who were fortunate enough to have both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> time and the money was the shooting up the Yangtse
    River, which used to be done in houseboats. These
    boats were most comfortable, with every sort of convenience,
    drew so little water that they could go almost
    anywhere, and the sport was excellent. Quite respectable
    bags used to be made of pheasants and wild duck, and,
    in addition, the snipe-shooting was extraordinarily good.</p>
<p>After Shanghai, we proceeded direct to Japan.
    Japan has been so minutely described and written
    up by so many distinguished men of letters, that any
    observations of mine would merely result in a poor
    attempt to paint the lily; but it is interesting to have
    seen, in 1875, some of the early period of the Europeanising
    of that country. In the real country districts,
    where a good walker with a jinriksha in attendance
    could travel considerable distances into the interior,
    it was still &ldquo;Old Japan,&rdquo; and what could be more
    attractive? In the towns everything was in the
    transition stage. For instance, the metropolitan policeman
    of Yeddo and Yokohama was being evolved,
    his uniform generally consisting in a copy of our
    police helmet and absolutely nothing else but his
    truncheon. But anyhow, whether old, or new Japan,
    it was a pleasant country in which to pass the summer.</p>
<p>Before returning south to Hong Kong, Vladivostock
    and Tientsin were visited, and at Tientsin I spent
    some of my pleasantest days on the China Station.
    Commander the Honourable Edward Dawson,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> commanding H.M.S. <i>Dwarf</i>, was kind enough to
    allow me to accept the hospitality of the wardroom
    officers of his ship, then stationed up the
    river, and on board her I spent ten very agreeable
    days. It was then a great place for paper chasing on
    pony back, and many were the good gallops we had
    over the fine open country surrounding Tientsin.
    The snipe-shooting, too, was capital fun. We used
    to start early in the morning on our ponies, ride for
    some six or eight miles, and come back a few hours
    later with generally some fifty couple of snipe; without
    dogs and with no beaters, and four very inferior
    guns, this meant as much shooting as one could
    reasonably expect. To show what could be done, one
    of the residents there, who was really a fine shot,
    used constantly to get a good deal more than our
    united bag to his own gun, assisted only by two
    Chinese coolies, whom he had trained to watch exactly
    where the birds fell, so as to retrieve for him. Dogs,
    even had we possessed them, were of very little use,
    for they were constantly drinking the very foul water
    that irrigated the paddy-fields (the favourite habitation
    of the snipe), and generally died of some sort of
    internal disease.</p>
<p>Another interesting place visited was Manilla, where
    the <i>Audacious</i> called in the course of the following
    winter. The cigar merchants there, received us with
    the greatest hospitality, and one of the items of the
    round of amusements they provided for us was a
    cricket match. Apparently, the unwritten law of cricket
    in Manilla was that enormous tumblers of iced beer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> should be set down and kept constantly refilled,
    a foot or so behind the stumps. Of course, the
    bowlers, wicket-keeper and batsmen, being in the
    immediate vicinity, had all the best of it; but when
    the &ldquo;over&rdquo; was called, the out-fields, if not too lazy
    to cross over, had their opportunity to pay attention
    to the glasses if they felt inclined. As the heat was
    terrific and these tumblers were in constant use, the
    unfortunate native whose business it was to keep them
    filled must have been fairly exhausted by his constant
    journeys from the pavilion to the wicket and back,
    before the day was over. Dinner succeeded cricket,
    and after dinner an adjournment was made to the
    Opera. The Opera House, which was established at
    one end of the local bull-ring, was only covered in
    with canvas, and the scenery was therefore of a more
    than usually flimsy character. The travelling company
    gave the <i>Trovatore</i>, and I can still remember how the
    prison bars trembled, nearly bringing the canvas roof
    down, when the tenor, as Manrico, was singing his passionate
    farewell&mdash;&ldquo;Addio, Leonora; Leonora, addio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time was slipping away, and I had long since been
    relieved of my Staff duties, when a second opportunity
    came (the first I ought to have taken a year before), of
    going home to pass the necessary examinations. There
    happened to be at that time on the Station one of the
    most remarkable hybrids, in the shape of a ship, that
    the genius of the Admiralty had ever produced. She
    was named the <i>Thalia</i>, was a sort of spurious corvette,
    and she and her consort, the <i>Juno</i>,&mdash;the only two of
    the class that were ever built,&mdash;were known in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> Service as &ldquo;Fighting Troopers.&rdquo; Her peculiarity was
    that she was half corvette and half frigate in construction,&mdash;a
    corvette in that she carried her guns on
    the upper deck, and a frigate in that she possessed
    a main deck, which main deck, instead of being used
    for the armament, could be utilised for berthing troops.
    In case of a sudden emergency I suppose she might
    possibly have embarked one wing of an ordinary
    Infantry battalion, with the necessary officers.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the summer of 1876 the <i>Thalia</i> was ordered home, and filled up with supernumeraries
    for passage to England. We were a motley collection!
    We had on board the officers and crews of two or
    three gunboats whose time had expired; a certain
    number of acting sub-lieutenants who, like myself,
    were on their way home to pass their examinations;
    a number of officers who had been tried for various
    offences and had been dismissed their ships, or the
    Service (amongst others, I remember there was a
    young officer, belonging to the garrison, who had
    been broken for cheating at cards); and, to top up
    with, there were a number of Court-martial prisoners,
    some of whom had to go home to serve long terms
    of penal servitude. The Captain, who was a very
    fine seaman of the old school, consoled himself with
    the reflection that, though he had a very scratch lot
    of officers and men to serve under him, if anything
    happened we should have been such an undeniable
    haul for the devil that, in all probability, we should
    reach England safely and without any contretemps.
    And so, accordingly, we started to make a sailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> passage home, coal only to be used in case of absolute
    necessity. We were short of everything when we
    started. All the Chinese servants and cooks had to
    be discharged before the ship left the Station. We,
    in the gunroom, had no servants except the sort we
    could improvise out of the very mixed material that
    was on board, and no money to buy stores. There
    was nothing for it but to live on ship&rsquo;s provisions,
    and so great was the crowd on board that water was
    also very short, and we were on an allowance of one
    small basin full for all purposes&mdash;cooking, drinking
    and washing&mdash;not a very liberal allowance in the
    tropics. However, nothing matters when one is homeward
    bound, not even a passage in a sort of convict-ship,
    for more or less a convict ship she was, as the
    penal servitude prisoners counted their time on board
    as part of their sentence; it was also carried out, so
    far as hard labour was concerned, by exercising them
    at shot drill on the quarter-deck.</p>
<p>We were a cheery lot in the gunroom, and we
    arranged to trade with the saloon messman, who having
    a small allowance from the Admiralty for messing the
    supernumeraries, managed somehow to produce a
    few necessaries, wet and dry. As I had charge of
    a watch I rather enjoyed my time until we got to the
    Red Sea, where we were compelled to steam from
    Aden to Suez without a break. Beyond coming in
    for a short but very violent gale on our way from
    Port Said, nothing else of interest happened, and we
    duly arrived at Plymouth, having taken nearly four
    months to get home;&mdash;not a very speedy journey, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> anyhow it was better than the <i>Audacious&rsquo;</i> performance
    on the way out.</p>
<p>After a little leave, the next thing to do was to get
    through the necessary examinations. Gunnery came
    first, so a whole batch of acting sub-lieutenants took
    up their abode at the old Naval College at Portsmouth,
    to drill on board the <i>Excellent</i>, the gunnery ship that
    used to lie up the Creek where the naval barracks now
    stand. I was very keen to take a first-class if I could,
    which meant very hard work in and out of hours, as,
    besides having practically to perform all the drill of
    every arm carried by a man-of-war, it was also necessary
    to learn what might be called the &ldquo;patter&rdquo; of the
    business&mdash;pages and pages of the gunnery and small-arms
    drill-books&mdash;the idea being that one should be able
    to pass on the extensive knowledge thus acquired to
    others. It was then that I, from a very respectful
    distance, first came into contact with Admiral Sir
    Reginald Custance, who was the senior lieutenant on
    the instruction staff of the <i>Excellent</i> at that time, and
    consequently head examining officer. We sub-lieutenants
    were in a holy terror of him, knowing that we
    had eventually to pass through his hands at the final
    examination, and, being aware that this subsequently-very-distinguished
    officer, had the reputation of not
    suffering fools gladly. One way and another our
    noses were kept very closely to the grindstone, and
    there was not much to do in the way of amusement
    except after dinner, when we became great patrons of
    the drama in the front row of the pit of the old Portsmouth
    Theatre. It was then that I made my first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> acquaintance with Offenbach. An excellent travelling
    company was there for some weeks, giving, in turn, <i>La Grande Duchesse</i>, <i>La Perichole</i>, and many more
    of those delightful comic operas so deservedly popular
    at the time. After all, I greatly doubt whether
    anything as good in their way has ever been produced
    since. Moreover, the Prima Donna of the
    company was that delightful woman and artist, known
    on the stage as Madame Selina Dolaro. So no wonder
    that we boys were in the theatre every night of our lives.</p>
<p>The three months&rsquo; course at Portsmouth came to
    an end, and I was lucky enough to get a first-class
    certificate. And now, all I had to contemplate was the
    six months&rsquo; course at Greenwich College, which would
    complete my education. There was a good deal of
    luck, as well as knowledge, required to get first-class
    in seamanship and gunnery, but at Greenwich it was
    only necessary to work hard enough to make a first-class
    a certainty for any one who had any aptitude for
    mathematics, though for others who had not that aptitude,
    however superior in other ways, it meant hard
    work to scrape through. I regret to say that I made
    up my mind at once to do next to nothing. I knew
    that I could get a second-class without any difficulty,
    which would mean that I could spend most of my
    evenings and week-ends in London, and in fact that I
    could amuse myself to the top of my bent. If I went in
    for a first-class it involved hard study, which I disliked
    particularly, though it would result in instantaneous
    promotion to the rank of lieutenant. I had been acting
    sub-lieutenant so long that the whole difference in
    seniority would amount to only about a year; a year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> did not seem much to worry about, and so&mdash;<i>vive le
    plaisir!</i> I need hardly say that I was not the only
    one who held the same views. The class I was in
    was composed of an extremely cheerful crew, who
    earned, and I believe deserved, the reputation of being
    the wildest and laziest class that ever went through
    Greenwich; but we did enjoy ourselves! There was
    plenty of cricket in the summer, football in the winter,
    excellent racquet courts for every season; and, moreover,
    there was the Gaiety Theatre, at the time when
    that delightful quartette, Nellie Farren, Kate Vaughan,
    Terry and Royce, were at their best and brightest.
    I am afraid to think of the number of times I went
    to see <i>Little Don Cæsar de Bazan</i>, but, at any rate,
    most of us could have passed a much better examination
    in the libretto of that cleverest of burlesques than
    we eventually did in our abhorred Euclid.</p>
<p>All went merrily until it came to the last fortnight
    before the final examination, and then it became necessary
    to turn night into day and try to pump in enough
    knowledge, through assiduous cramming, to make sure
    of a pass,&mdash;such things as first-classes having vanished
    altogether from our perspective. The examination
    lasted a week, and when daily comparing notes we all
    felt happy up to the last day, but the last paper we
    had to tackle (I forget the subject) fairly broke us
    down. Whether it really was of a more than usually
    high standard I know not, but anyhow we all agreed
    that, in our several spheres, it had been our ruin, so in
    this desperate condition we thought we might as well
    celebrate our failure by embarking on a terrific bear-fight,
    after what we fondly imagined would be our last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> dinner at Greenwich. Unfortunately the bear-fight
    assumed such proportions that the Authorities got
    very cross about it. The whole lot of us were put
    under arrest, and were solemnly tried by a Court of
    Inquiry, held at Greenwich by the Admiralty for the
    purpose. I, for my sins, was the senior officer, having
    had acting rank for so long, so I had to speak for my
    brother malefactors. There really was not a great deal
    to say; it would not have been easy to explain to the
    officers of the Court that we were dissatisfied with
    an examination paper, so no excuse was attempted.
    The upshot was that we were all sent to guardships
    for a month under arrest, instead of being given the
    leave we had earned after a long and trying course of
    instruction. Presently, the result of the examination
    came out. Three were plucked and put back for three
    months. Luckily for me, I had succeeded in taking a
    second-class, which was all I could expect.</p>
<p>Very shortly after my month&rsquo;s arrest had expired,
    I was appointed to H.M.S. <i>Agincourt</i>, the flagship of
    Rear-Admiral Sir Edmund Commerell. Sir Edmund
    had been ordered to the East with his flagship and
    the <i>Achilles</i> to reinforce Admiral Sir Geoffrey Hornby
    (the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean
    Station), and also to take up the post of Second in
    Command. The <i>Agincourt</i> having left England, I took
    passage in a P. &amp; O. steamer to Malta and remained
    there on board the guardship <i>Hibernia</i> waiting for
    an opportunity of joining my own ship. But the
    importance of the situation in the Middle East in
    1877-78 deserves a chapter to itself.</p>

<h3>THE DARDANELLES IN 1878</h3>
<p>Shortly after my arrival at Malta, the <i>Sultan</i> came
    in for a refit and to give leave, and I was appointed to
    her for the time being, my own ship, the <i>Agincourt</i>,
    being in Eastern waters, and in the <i>Sultan</i> I remained
    for nearly six months. She was then commanded by
    Captain H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh, one of
    the smartest of our young captains afloat, and on
    board of her I first made the acquaintance of comrades
    who were, in the future, amongst my best friends, and
    who also, incidentally, became some of the most distinguished
    officers in the Navy. Nearly all of them
    made their mark in later days. Among the lieutenants
    were the subsequent Admiral of the Fleet, the late Sir
    Assheton Curzon Howe, and Prince Louis of Battenberg,
    now Admiral the Marquis of Milford Haven;
    whilst amongst the midshipmen were Admirals Sir
    Stanley Colville and Sir Colin Keppel, both well-known
    and distinguished officers. There were a good many
    also who did not persevere long in the Navy. One of
    the sub-lieutenants, a great friend of mine, was Mr.
    Frank Alexander, the well-known racing man who left
    the Service as soon as he was promoted; he followed in
    the footsteps of his father, Mr. Caledon Alexander, and
    raced up to the end of his life. Another great friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> of mine was Charles le Strange, then a lieutenant. I
    was destined to serve under him in later years, and
    through him I had the good fortune of spending some
    pleasant evenings in the company of that very brilliant
    man and amusing writer, Laurence Oliphant, his
    brother-in-law.</p>
<p>Not long after I had taken up my abode in the <i>Sultan</i>, she received orders to join the Flag at Vourlah
    Bay, and, after a short cruise in Grecian waters, the
    whole Mediterranean Fleet settled down at Besika
    Bay, as we thought for the winter. Admiral Sir
    Geoffrey Hornby was then flying his flag on board
    the <i>Alexandra</i>, with Captain Fitzroy as Flag-Captain,
    Lieutenant Winsloe (subsequently Commander-in-Chief
    in the China Station) as Flag-Lieutenant, and the
    Honourable Hedworth Lambton (now Admiral of the
    Fleet Sir Hedworth Meux) as his Flag-Mate.</p>
<p>Ever since the commencement of the Russo-Turkish
    War, our Mediterranean Fleet, subsequently reinforced
    by the <i>Agincourt</i> and the <i>Achilles</i>, had been in
    Eastern waters, making Besika Bay, which is situated
    close to the Dardanelles entrance, their headquarters;
    and a very trying time it had been to officers and
    men,&mdash;unspeakably so to the latter. The only communication
    with the outer world, except the mails
    which were generally about a fortnight old, was the
    daily Reuter telegram received by the flagship and
    signalled round the Fleet. It would probably occur to
    the ordinary mind that the Admiralty might have
    remembered that the officers and men of a large Fleet,
    possibly on the verge of a European war, were deserv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>ing
    of some consideration in the way of news from
    day to day. But apparently such an idea never struck
    them, so the officers duly subscribed for their telegram,
    which, like most other blessings in this world, had
    to be paid for. Bets were taken and laid almost
    daily, as to whether we would, or would not, go up
    the Dardanelles, and also as to whether we would, or
    would not, go to war with Russia, and, apparently, the
    Cabinet of the day were as uncertain as we were. I
    remember a telegram received only a few days before
    we actually started,&mdash;the alliteration, I suppose, kept
    it in my memory:&mdash;&ldquo;Cabinet said to be almost
    unanimous on necessity of proceeding up Dardanelles.
    Derby doubtful.&rdquo; As may be remembered, the
    present Lord Derby&rsquo;s great-uncle was then Foreign
    Secretary, and was always supposed to possess what is
    called &ldquo;the cross-bench&rdquo; mind.</p>
<p>It was bad enough for the officers; but they could
    occasionally get a day&rsquo;s shooting or hunting, though the
    shooting was generally spoilt by the number of guns,
    as what would have provided really good sport and
    amusement for one ship was not likely to suffice for a
    large Fleet. But as far as the men were concerned,
    they had literally nothing to do in the way of amusement.
    The best sport at Besika was the hunting.
    The Commander-in-Chief, remembering, I suppose, the
    great Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s pack of hounds in the
    Peninsula, instituted a pack at Besika. Kennels and
    stables were run up by the ships&rsquo; carpenters. The
    Admiral and many of the senior officers had their own
    horses, and we small fry used to hire from the Beef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> Contractor. That functionary,&mdash;who probably died a
    millionaire,&mdash;managed to provide almost everything in
    life, and could always get hold of horses with a fair
    proportion of legs among them. Captain Hunt
    Grubbe was the Master, one of the Chaplains in the
    Fleet, the Reverend H. Gilbert, was Huntsman, and
    very good fun it all was. There were plenty of foxes,
    a fine open grass country, and many was the good
    gallop we had.</p>
<p>The date of the last time I was out with the hounds,
    February 9th, 1878, became almost a landmark in
    history. We had had a good run and were a longish
    way from home, when, the hounds being checked, and
    the field pulled up, we suddenly heard in the distance the
    repeated strains of the Officers&rsquo; Call. Mounted buglers
    had been sent to the top of the neighbouring hills to
    sound the Call, and in a few moments hounds were
    whipped off and we were all on our way back to
    the landing place at Besika. On our return to our
    ship we speedily learnt the reason. Orders had been
    received from the Admiralty that the Fleet was to
    proceed up the Dardanelles, so we found our comrades
    busy preparing for sea, and clearing away for action.
    Of course, we were the Turk&rsquo;s best friends; but the
    Pasha in command of the forts had the reputation
    of not being over-trustworthy, and it was thought
    extremely possible that Russian &ldquo;baksheesh&rdquo; might
    induce him to make it very unpleasant for us in the
    Narrows; so we were taking no chances.</p>
<p>The Fleet sailed the same evening from Besika, but
    the firman from the Sultan, giving permission to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> the forts, not having arrived, our ships anchored later at
    the mouth of the Straits. The Government then had
    to be communicated with to ask,&mdash;in the case of the
    firman never arriving,&mdash;whether the Fleet was to
    force a passage. Eventually, the Members of the
    Government succeeded in making up their minds, and
    the Fleet was ordered up, <i>coûte que coûte</i>; so, on the
    morning of February the 13th the Fleet weighed and
    steamed up the Dardanelles in the teeth of a northerly
    gale, and one of the thickest snowstorms I ever saw at
    sea. My station being at the forecastle guns, I
    received the full benefit of the snow; even there,
    in the eyes of the ship, it was only just possible to see
    &ldquo;one&rsquo;s next ahead.&rdquo; In the &rsquo;seventies ten knots was
    about the highest speed at which a squadron could be
    man&#339;uvred, so what with the gale and the snowstorm,
    to say nothing of the strong current that runs through
    the Dardanelles, it was no great wonder that the <i>Alexandra</i> took the shore. The spot she selected
    was just opposite the great fort at Chanak, and my ship
    being the next astern of her was detailed to tow her
    off. It was an exceedingly difficult job; but the
    Duke of Edinburgh, who, in the opinion of the Commander-in-Chief,
    was, of all his Captains, about the
    best handler of a big ship, succeeded in doing what
    was necessary, so, after four hours&rsquo; hard work, we
    rejoined the rest of the Fleet close to the entrance of
    the Sea of Marmora. It was just as well for us that
    the before-mentioned Pasha had not been &ldquo;squared,&rdquo;
    for, as the mischance above described took place
    immediately opposite the most heavily armed fort at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> Chanak in the very narrowest part of the Narrows,
    I need hardly emphasise the fact that both the ship
    ashore and the consort trying to tow her off, would
    have been reduced to matchwood in a very short time
    by a heavily armed fort firing at a range of a few
    hundred yards.</p>
<p>Shortly after our arrival in the Sea of Marmora,
    the Commander-in-Chief divided his forces. The
    larger portion of the Fleet, including the most
    powerful units he possessed, were under his own
    immediate command, and remained in the neighbourhood
    of Constantinople. What might be termed the
    Second Division, under Sir John Commerell, was
    ordered to Gallipoli. The Fleet being thus broken
    up, resulted so far as I was concerned in my leaving
    the <i>Sultan</i> and joining the ship to which I had been
    appointed many months before.</p>
<p>Whilst in the Marmora I made the personal acquaintance
    of a man whose sensational career excited a great
    deal of attention a few years afterwards. I allude
    to the then Prince Alexander of Battenberg, who was
    at that time serving on the Staff of General Gourko,
    commanding the Russian Army Corps that, after hard
    fighting and still greater hardships, had succeeded in
    crossing the Balkans. The Prince managed to get a
    few days&rsquo; leave, and came on board the <i>Sultan</i> for a
    short visit to his relative, the Duke of Edinburgh, and
    his brother, Prince Louis, then a lieutenant on board the <i>Sultan</i>. There was nothing very remarkable about this
    incident, except for the shameful abuse that was hurled
    at the Duke of Edinburgh by an obscure London news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>paper
    (long since dead!) on account of this very harmless
    visit. The Duke having married a Russian Grand
    Duchess, was accused of every sort of villainy&mdash;&ldquo;owing
    to his well-known (?) Russian proclivities he was
    capable of allowing a Russian Staff Officer to penetrate
    the secrets of the British Fleet&rdquo;; &ldquo;he was harbouring
    Russian spies,&rdquo;&mdash;and in fact a very venomous and
    lying series of imaginative articles appeared, and, as
    always, a certain amount of the mud thrown stuck.
    The most ludicrous part of the business was that this
    most important Russian Staff Officer and reputed spy
    was, in those days, extremely young, and came on
    board the <i>Sultan</i> with the full knowledge and consent
    of the Commander-in-Chief, who, like any other reasonable
    man, had not the slightest objection to permitting
    a young officer to have a few days&rsquo; rest, in comfort,
    with a bed to sleep in, and a chance of seeing his
    relatives. Prince Alexander made himself very agreeable
    during his short stay on board; perhaps the
    best-looking member of a very handsome family, he
    looked absolutely fitted for the romantic career to
    which Fate later destined him.</p>
<p>It was a long and trying time that we spent at the
    anchorage off the town of Gallipoli. The map of that
    part of the world must be so indelibly stamped on the
    memories of our countrymen by recent hostilities that
    no topographical description is necessary. The general
    situation in the winter of 1877-78 was this: There
    was a small but well-equipped Turkish Army of a
    strength of between 20,000 and 30,000 men, which,
    after a successful retreat, had fallen back on the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> Bulair lines which date back to Crimean days. The
    lines cross the neck of the Peninsula, just to the
    Eastern end of the town of Gallipoli, at the very
    narrowest part of the neck. Indeed, it is only about
    eight miles as the crow flies, from sea to sea. The
    Commander-in-Chief being in the Marmora, the Second
    Division, under Sir John Commerell, was left at
    Gallipoli, at the moment a very important strategic
    position. In case of war with Russia it was thought
    that the Turkish Army at Bulair, assisted by that
    portion of the British Fleet, could, at any rate, make
    certain of holding the all-important Peninsula pending
    later developments. Sir John Commerell&rsquo;s Division
    was disposed as follows:&mdash;Half of his Fleet, including
    his own flagship, the <i>Agincourt</i>, lay at Gallipoli, and
    the other half at Imbros, on the northern side of the
    peninsula; and there for months we lay, with slips on
    our cables and steam up, ready to proceed on the
    shortest notice to the two extreme flanks of the Bulair
    line, and thus be in a position to enfilade any advancing
    troops attempting to attack those lines. Signals were
    pre-arranged with the Pasha in command at Bulair, and
    once again the usual bets as to whether war would be
    declared or not were taken almost daily. During the
    day, when not on duty, leave was given to officers,
    but our only amusement was to gallop about the
    country inside the lines, or ride over to Imbros and
    play cricket with the Imbros Squadron, where the
    officers had managed to find quite a decently flat field.
    At Gallipoli there was nothing of the same kind, but as
    a set-off we had the joys of town life, as exemplified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> by a squalid Turkish village, adorned by the illustrious
    presence of the British Vice-Consul and his family,
    to say nothing of the inevitable beef contractor and his
    belongings.</p>
<p>A very short time after we took up our station at
    Gallipoli we received information to the effect that,
    before war was actually declared, the Russians would
    make an attempt to attack the Fleet with torpedoes.
    Torpedo warfare was then in its earliest infancy, but
    something could be done with spar torpedoes by an
    enterprising enemy, and, as a matter of fact, earlier
    in the war the Russians had succeeded in blowing up
    and sinking a couple of small Turkish monitors on
    the Danube. A steamboat patrol was therefore organised,
    as an additional protection to the Fleet, which
    otherwise had only its ordinary armament on which to
    rely. In those days, nets and quick-firing guns were
    non-existent, and the ordinary armament of our iron-clads
    was extremely unsuitable for the repelling of
    night attacks, if delivered by a swarm of steamboats,
    great and small. In the &rsquo;seventies our allowance of
    steamboats for ships of all sizes was very limited,
    so between us I doubt whether we, on the Gallipoli
    side, could have mustered more than half a dozen all
    told, and as the nights were very long, and the weather
    nearly always abominable, sometimes two were as many
    as we could manage to produce on patrol at a time.
    Though steam-pinnaces were scarce, sub-lieutenants
    were fairly numerous, and I never could understand
    why it fell to my lot to be away on patrol duty
    every night of my life, while my messmates were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> in their turn, snoring in their hammocks. But so
    it was.</p>
<p>Our largest steam-pinnace at that time was very little
    over thirty feet long, no shelter was provided for the
    engineer and crew&mdash;except tarpaulin screens, for the
    only part that was decked over was the forecastle where
    the gun was mounted. The cold was bitter, and in
    those days neither officers nor men possessed such a
    thing as a great coat, so the only way to keep comparatively
    warm was to put on as many garments as one
    conveniently could, and retain what caloric one could
    collect inside, by enveloping the whole fabric in oilskins.
    I contrived to keep going until the end, which was
    naturally a great deal more than the pinnaces could
    manage to do without reinforcements being sent from
    England, and these reinforcements deserve mention.
    Directly the patrol was started it was pointed out to
    the Admiralty that more steamboats were urgently
    needed, and it would be a great advantage that they
    should be decked nearly all over. The Admiralty
    behaved with commendable promptitude, and soon
    afterwards a steamer arrived at Gallipoli with a consignment
    of boats. We were all agog to see the latest
    thing in patrol-boats just arriving from England, and
    no one was more personally interested than I myself,
    with the hopeful vision of keeping dry in the future.
    It is hardly believable, but it is none the less true, that
    our new patrol-boats turned out to be a consignment
    of Thames pleasure-boats! Their scantling was so
    thin that one bump against a ladder would certainly
    have stove them in, and so absolutely unseaworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> were they that they could only be used in the very
    finest weather,&mdash;a very rare commodity in Gallipoli.
    I suppose that, although England was still at peace,
    the probabilities of war were near enough to give the
    profiteer (a breed we now know so fatally well!) his
    chance, and these boats were the result. Anyhow,
    they were slightly better than none at all, as they
    could run about in the daytime, if the weather were
    fine enough, and thus save our pinnaces. The trouble
    was to name these curious hybrids, for a boat has to be
    given some sort of a name for the purpose of manning
    her. This difficulty was temporarily overcome by
    endowing them with Christian names, which we were
    led to believe were those of the female relatives of the
    Admiral and his Staff. However, this nomenclature
    did not last long. Even the most hard-hearted and
    cynical of parents could not endure the knowledge
    that, owing to the inherent defects of these craft, the
    familiar names of his daughters were being coupled
    hourly with all the most abusive epithets in the sailor&rsquo;s
    vocabulary.</p>
<p>Though the Armistice was signed at San Stephano
    between Russia and Turkey in the month of March,
    relations between England and Russia remained so
    strained that no relaxation took place in the patrol
    until many months had passed. In June, on the
    strength of all the boat work which I had done down
    to that time, I managed to coax a fortnight&rsquo;s leave out
    of the Authorities, and I and another sub-lieutenant
    went to Constantinople for a holiday. Of course, it was
    a most interesting moment to be there. Constantinople<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> was swarming with Russian Officers, who had
    also arranged to get leave from the Front. They
    mainly consisted of officers of that favoured Corps,
    the Imperial Guard, and we Britishers were much
    impressed by the magnificence of their turn-out. They
    all appeared to be in brand-new and very smart
    uniforms, and there was nothing about them to show
    that they had just fought their way through a very
    trying campaign. The other memory I have of Constantinople
    is of a very different nature. I went to
    visit the great mosque of Ste. Sophia, and never shall
    I forget the horror of it. Thousands of refugees, who
    had fled before the advance of the Russian troops, were
    camped out on the floor of the great mosque in every
    stage of suffering, disease and filth. Wretched women
    and children were there, without any sort of comfort;
    smallpox was obviously raging, and the stench, from the
    lack of all sanitary arrangements, was enough to turn
    even the strongest stomach. I was not particularly
    squeamish in those days, but the experience remained
    in my memory, as a nightmare, for months afterwards.</p>
<p>The leave was all too short, and very soon I was
    back aboard the ship again, to learn, a few weeks afterwards,
    that I was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant.
    There being no available man-of-war going home just
    then, I, and two more newly promoted Lieutenants,
    were allowed to take a passage in a steamer and find
    our way home via Marseilles and Paris. Paris was
    then in the throes of the 1878 Exhibition, and consequently
    was very full and rather uncomfortable.
    However, we did our duty by spending a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> days in visiting the Exhibition, and presently I found
    myself back in England and temporarily my own
    master, for, from the moment I set foot in my native
    country I became a Lieutenant on half-pay whilst
    waiting for further employment.</p>
<p>I may as well mention that the half-pay in question
    amounted to the munificent sum of four shillings per
    diem,&mdash;less than half the daily stipend of the present-day
    police constable.</p>
<p>Of course I was delighted to be promoted and to
    get home; but it was with very real regret that I had
    said good-bye to many of my brother officers in the <i>Agincourt</i>, and most of all was I sorry to be no longer
    serving under the flag of Sir Edmund Commerell.
    Surely there never could have been a Flag-Officer
    more beloved than was Sir Edmund. Literally one of
    the bravest of the brave, he had won his Victoria Cross
    in the Crimea. Later, when Commodore of the South
    African Station, he was very dangerously wounded
    whilst leading a boat attack up one of the West
    African rivers. His popularity in the Fleet was unbounded,
    his officers and men really loved him, and
    what was more remarkable still, was the hold he
    had established over the Turk. In the ranks of the
    Bulair Army they all knew that the British Admiral
    was an old Crimean Veteran, on the strength of which
    they spoke of him as Ghazi Commerell Pasha. As an
    instance of his never-failing courage, I well remember
    his behaviour on an occasion when his galley had been
    capsized. The Admiral was passionately fond of boat
    sailing, and, moreover, was a great expert; so one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> of his amusements was to take his galley for a spin
    round the Fleet. On this particular occasion at
    Gallipoli it was hardly a galley&rsquo;s day, for it was blowing
    a strong breeze with nasty squalls. However, away
    he went. When an Admiral is sailing his boat a very
    sharp look-out is always kept by the officer of the
    watch, and so when, after a very heavy squall, his boat
    was seen to capsize, there was no delay in sending a
    steamboat away post-haste to pick him up. When the
    sub-lieutenant in charge of the boat arrived, he
    naturally selected the Admiral as being the proper
    person to be rescued first; but nothing would induce
    him to be touched until every member of the boat&rsquo;s
    crew was on board the pinnace. Meanwhile, encumbered
    as he was with a heavy boat cloak, the dear
    old gentleman had swallowed such a quantity of salt
    water, that he was in measurable distance of being
    drowned.</p>
<p>He was always most anxious to try and do something
    to alleviate the terrible monotony of the men&rsquo;s lives at
    that time. Leave was out of the question, so everything
    had to be done on board. The <i>Agincourt</i> had a
    splendidly clear upper deck, so there was no difficulty
    in laying out a racing track of ten laps to the mile, and
    many were the exciting contests that took place upon it.
    The most popular of all was a ten-mile go-as-you-please
    race between selected candidates from the marines and
    bluejackets respectively, the conditions being heavy
    marching order, the bluejackets to be dressed like the
    marines in busby and tunic, so as to make the conditions
    absolutely equal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p>Another amusement was what the sailors used to call
    a sing-song. The upper deck being covered in, the
    Admiral and his Staff and officers not on duty being
    present, all the available talent on the ship was
    mobilised for a so-called musical entertainment. The
    most successful turn was given by one of the sub-lieutenants,
    who had some sort of a voice that had
    been partially trained during his time at Greenwich,
    and he used to give us the classic song, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
    want to fight.&rdquo; This song, as rendered by the &ldquo;great
    McDermott,&rdquo; was the rage of the London Music Halls
    during the Russo-Turkish War. It was all very well
    for the peace party, who are always with us under all
    circumstances, to jeer at the vulgarity of the song and
    decry the so-called jingoism that was derived from it;
    but when sung by a thousand men, who were expecting
    every moment to be actively employed in taking
    measures to make it a certainty that &ldquo;The Russians
    shall not have Constantinople,&rdquo; it became rather more
    than a comic music-hall song. There was a grim
    earnestness about it as then sung on the quarter-deck
    of a man-of-war, that made it almost impressive, and
    eliminated its vulgarity.</p>
<p>Many years afterwards, when Sir Edmund stood as
    Conservative Candidate for Southampton, with these
    incidents in my memory, the cleanliness (?) of English
    electioneering practices was brought intimately home to
    me. He lost whatever chance he may have had of
    being elected in a constituency full of seafaring men,
    on account of a poster that was displayed all over
    Southampton by the agents of his opponent. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> Admiral, one of the kindest and most chivalrous of
    gentlemen, was portrayed to the electors of Southampton
    as a prize specimen of the old flogging captain of the
    early part of the century. The poster actually depicted
    him, in cocked hat and epaulets, flourishing an enormous
    cat-o&rsquo;-nine tails over the bare back, streaming with
    blood, of a bluejacket seized up to the breech of a
    gun.</p>
<p>Later on, he was Commander-in-Chief of the North
    American and West Indian Stations, Commander-in-Chief
    at Portsmouth, and afterwards for many years a
    Groom-in-Waiting to Queen Victoria.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>
<h3>EGYPT IN 1882</h3>
<p>About the period at which I was promoted to the
    rank of Lieutenant the number of ships in commission
    was so small that there was a great deal of unemployment
    in all ranks of the officers of the Navy. For
    instance, a freshly promoted lieutenant, unless he
    intended to specialise in gunnery (the torpedo lieutenant
    had not then been invented), had to wait for
    the greater part of two years before being appointed
    to a ship. Captains frequently had to wait for as
    much as four years. Quite apart from the manifest
    injustice of leaving officers to starve for years on the
    most miserable scale of half-pay that ever was devised
    by a Government Department, nothing could have
    been invented more calculated to injure the Service.
    For young lieutenants it meant a long period of
    inactivity at the average age of from twenty-three to
    twenty-four&mdash;just the years in which they should have
    been acquiring the habit of command, as watch-keepers,
    and inculcating discipline as divisional officers; whilst
    for young captains it may even have been worse;
    four years of unemployment ashore at the average
    age of forty was as likely a scheme for promoting rust
    instead of polish, on what is considered the finished
    article of the British Navy&mdash;namely the Captain of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> man-of-war&mdash;as could be devised by mortal man. A
    certain amount could be done to mitigate the situation
    by short courses of gunnery, and officers were even
    graciously permitted to study at Greenwich on half-pay.
    A good many took advantage of this permission,
    principally because, in their necessarily impoverished
    condition, they found the mess there the cheapest
    place to live in. But even when every advantage was
    taken in the way of courses of education, there would
    be still long intervals of unemployment. Personally,
    I enjoyed my time on half-pay very much. I was
    fortunate enough to have a home to go to where there
    was sport of all kinds to amuse me, and I was not at
    all averse from being my own master after nearly ten
    years of a junior officer&rsquo;s life under the strictest
    discipline.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1880 Sir Geoffrey Hornby&rsquo;s time
    was up in the Mediterranean, and he was succeeded
    as Commander-in-Chief by Sir Beauchamp Seymour,
    who, when a captain, had given me my nomination
    for the Navy. At one time he had, I believe, the
    intention of taking me as his Flag-Lieutenant; but,
    unfortunately, the bump of veneration for those set
    in authority over me was represented on my head by
    a large hollow, and a few expressions of opinion about
    some of my superiors that I had either uttered, or
    was supposed to have uttered, got round to his ears,
    with the result that he wrote to my father and told
    him that although his original intention had been to
    take me as his Flag-Lieutenant, he really could not have
    a young officer on his Staff who expressed such very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> remarkable opinions about his superior officers. At
    the time I was not in the least anxious to go as Flag-Lieutenant.
    Haul-down promotions had been abolished,
    so there really was nothing particular to gain by it
    except that, of course, it was what is known in modern
    days as a &ldquo;cushy job.&rdquo; But, later on, I had real
    cause for regret, as, owing to the Egyptian War, Sir
    Beauchamp became a peer, and, what would have concerned
    me much more, his Flag-Lieutenant was promoted
    over some 300 or 400 lieutenants&rsquo; heads, including
    my own. When that moment arrived I consoled
    myself by winning a biggish bet from my brother
    officers, none of whom thought that such a leap in
    the way of promotion was possible, I having,&mdash;rightly,
    as it turned out,&mdash;taken the other view.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, I was destined to go on the
    Staff of a Commander-in-Chief before Sir Beauchamp
    Seymour had hoisted his flag; for, in January 1880,
    Admiral the Honourable Sir Charles Brydone Elliot
    was appointed Commander-in-Chief at Plymouth and
    offered me the post of Flag-Lieutenant. Sir Beauchamp,
    who was still a Lord of the Admiralty, knew nothing
    of this offer, and had, in the meantime, appointed me
    to a small craft in the East Indies. I went to see
    him at the Admiralty, and, before I had time to
    explain that I wished my appointment cancelled as
    I had already written to Sir Charles Elliot accepting
    his offer, the dear old gentleman, with a fine sense
    of irony, proceeded to congratulate me on my appointment
    to an old sloop commanded by one of the most
    unpopular officers in the Service, and serving on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> of the most unpleasant stations in the Navy,&mdash;namely
    the East Indies and Persian Gulf. After he had
    finished his speech, I told him that I regretted very
    much that I must ask for a cancellation of such a
    charming appointment; but that, as Admiral Sir
    Charles Elliot had done me the honour of asking me
    to serve as his Flag-Lieutenant, and as, moreover, I had
    accepted his offer, cancelled it would have to be. My
    venerable relative nearly had a fit on the spot, but
    it had to be done, and I must say that, though not
    very long afterwards I was serving in his Fleet, he
    never bore me the slightest malice, and was always
    a kind and most hospitable friend to me. Both of
    us being very fond of Bordeaux, many were the bottles
    that we drank together after dinners at the Admiralty
    House, for Sir Beauchamp belonged to the old school
    of men who settled steadily down to their wine after
    dinner, and looked upon tobacco as an abomination.</p>
<p>And so, in January 1880, I found myself occupying a
    shore appointment at Devonport; for the Commander-in-Chief
    of a home port lives entirely on shore, and
    practically never goes afloat, except for inspections.</p>
<p>To my great joy, there was no room for me in
    Admiralty House, so I settled down in lodgings round
    the corner, and, generally speaking, after luncheon was
    practically a free man unless there happened to be a
    dinner at Admiralty House. Altogether, it was a very
    pleasant life. Being Devonshire born I had plenty
    of friends and acquaintances, and it was a most hospitable
    neighbourhood. Mount Edgcumbe, Anthony,
    the charming home of my old friend, General Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> Reginald Pole Carew, and Port Eliot were all close by
    just over the Cornish boundary, while on the Devonshire
    side, and within easy reach by road, was Saltram,
    Lord Morley&rsquo;s fine place, then leased to two very kind
    friends of mine, Mr. and Mrs. Hartmann, who were
    there for twenty years. A little further on in the
    same neighbourhood was Flete, which has just been
    rebuilt by the late Mr. Bingham Mildmay; Membland,
    then the property of the late Lord Revelstoke; and,
    camped out between his two brothers-in-law, was the
    late Mr. John Bulteel at Pamflete, in the most lovely
    of cottages, full of beautiful china, and with some of
    the most remarkable claret I ever was lucky enough
    to come across, in his cellar.</p>
<p>I managed to keep a hunter and a pony and dog-cart,
    so what with a certain amount of hunting with
    the Dartmoor Hounds, and a good deal of shooting
    with all my kind friends in the neighbourhood, life
    was very agreeable. It was at Saltram that I first
    really learnt to take an intelligent interest in food.
    In those days French chefs were very rare in England.
    I do not believe there were more than half a dozen
    in the whole country; but at Saltram I made the
    acquaintance of one of the greatest of these benefactors
    of the human race, and he has been a friend of mine
    ever since. I allude to Monsieur Menager, who was
    for something like a quarter of a century with my
    friends, the Hartmanns, both in the country and in
    London, and subsequently for many years with the
    late King at Marlborough House and Buckingham
    Palace. I believe that he has now retired into private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> life, after a long and honourable career, and, taking
    him all in all, I do not think that I ever came across
    a greater artist in his profession.</p>
<p>When not on duty or amusing myself in the neighbourhood
    I spent most of my time at the Royal
    Western Yacht Club. The Club House was finely
    situated on the Hoe at Plymouth. It was, unfortunately,
    rather a long way from where I lived at Devonport,
    but none the less I generally dined there and
    found, moreover, an excellent rubber of whist before
    and after dinner. My whist education, if somewhat
    expensive, was very thorough, and I found later on
    in London that I could pretty well hold my own in
    most companies. Whist has probably vanished for
    ever, driven off the field by auction bridge, but none
    the less there never was a game of mingled science
    and luck that lasted longer, and I always think that
    the wise old Talleyrand was so right when he administered
    the gentle rebuke to the young man of the
    Travellers&rsquo; Club, who professed that he did not play
    it: &ldquo;Vous ne jouez pas le whist, jeune homme?
    Quelle triste vieillesse vous vous préparez?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some fifteen months, passed very agreeably
    at Devonport, it became obvious to me that it was
    about time I began to serve afloat again if I meant
    to go on in my profession, so, with the permission of
    the Admiral, I duly applied for a ship. Shortly before
    the time of which I am writing, the Admiralty had,
    in their wisdom, established a system of espionage on
    the officers of the Navy, which consisted of confidential
    reports from Commanding Officers relating not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> to their professional attainments but also as to the
    characters of the officers serving under their orders.
    Personally, I am very strongly of opinion that anything
    in the nature of a confidential report is an abomination.
    It puts vast powers for mischief into the hands of
    Commanding Officers, who, being human, are naturally
    full of imperfections. The spiteful ones, whom I hope
    and believe are scarce, can vent their spite on any
    subordinate who is distasteful to them; but a far more
    dangerous man to deal with is the honest faddist.
    The man who is prepared to go to the stake for his
    own opinions is generally ready to light the match that
    is necessary for the successful execution of those
    whose way of life differs from his, and God help the
    unfortunate lieutenant reported on by one of these
    upright, but narrow-minded gentlemen.</p>
<p>My Admiral was, consequently, obliged to report
    confidentially to the Admiralty on the members of his
    Staff. One of them, his secretary&rsquo;s clerk, being a
    friend of mine, thought it would amuse me to see
    what the old man had said about myself. It did
    amuse me very much, but I confess that the report in
    question gave me the impression that it was time for
    me to seek &ldquo;green fields and pastures new,&rdquo; ending, as
    it did after a slightly uncomplimentary comment on my
    general view of life, with the sentence: &ldquo;It is quite
    time that this young officer went to sea.&rdquo; I cordially
    agreed with the last sentence; but I still thought that
    it might have been spoken to me directly instead of
    being reported confidentially to the Admiralty. This,
    of course, was not the fault of my Chief, who was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> carrying out, what I still consider was, a very iniquitous
    order.</p>
<p>Early in the spring of 1881 I was appointed to
    the <i>Superb</i> on the Mediterranean Station, and before
    taking leave of my late Commander-in-Chief, I must
    relate a very curious incident which happened to him
    when a very young captain in the early &rsquo;forties, and I
    may add that he told me the story himself.</p>
<p>In those days, amongst the great naval families who
    assisted each other to all the best appointments in the
    Navy, the Elliots, the Greys, and the Seymours were
    extremely prominent. My Admiral was the son of
    the second Lord Minto. This Lord Minto, who at
    various stages of his career had been First Lord of the
    Admiralty and later on Treasurer of the Navy, was
    naturally able to insist that his son should be promoted
    to Captain at a very early age. I think he must have
    been promoted at the age of twenty-three or twenty-four.
    Captain Elliot, as he then was, was appointed in
    command of a sloop going out to the Pacific Station,
    and while commissioning her at a home port, he
    received a letter from an old friend and neighbour in
    Scotland to the following effect. This friend asked
    him, as a great personal favour, to make his son a
    midshipman (in those days a captain had the necessary
    power to rate any lad as a midshipman quite regardless
    of any details such as age and acquirements) and to
    take him with him in his ship. His reason for asking
    this favour was that his son was such an unreclaimable
    young blackguard that he could do nothing with him
    either at home or at any school, and he looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> the Navy as a sort of forlorn hope in the way of reformation.
    Naturally, Captain Elliot was averse to having
    this very doubtful benefit thrust upon him, but thinking
    that there was no great difficulty in inculcating a sense
    of discipline in a midshipman, and also thinking that
    as midshipmen were nearly always troublesome, one
    more or less did not make much difference, he weakly
    consented to take him. Unfortunately, life in the
    Navy did not have the reforming effect that was anticipated,
    and after every sort of thing had been tried to
    bring this young wretch to his bearings, the Captain
    decided that, as nothing else had any effect, he would
    try what a flogging would do. The midshipman in
    question being an extremely lusty youth, the punishment
    would do him no physical injury and great moral
    effects might possibly result. Accordingly, this young
    gentleman was duly seized up to the breech of a gun
    and solemnly given a dozen by the boatswain&rsquo;s mate;
    and then the comic side of the case developed. The
    boy wrote to his father and complained that he had been
    flogged, upon which this grateful specimen of a parent
    wrote a furious letter to the Admiralty and demanded
    that his old friend, neighbour, and benefactor, should
    be tried by Court-martial, and tried he promptly was.
    Fortunately, his interest in the Navy was far too
    powerful for any real mischief to result. The Court-martial
    found the charge proved; he was duly
    cautioned, and that was the end of it; but equally
    naturally he was always known in the Navy as the
    captain who had flogged a midshipman, and this
    reputation of a flogging-captain sat very oddly on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> the shoulders of a man who was the personification of
    kindness and gentleness.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1881 I joined my new ship, the <i>Superb</i> (Captain Thomas le Hunte Ward), and found
    the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Beauchamp Seymour,
    installed at Admiralty House, Valetta, with his Flag-Lieutenant,
    the Honourable Hedworth Lambton, in
    close attendance, and flying his flag aboard the <i>Alexandra</i>,
    and it was there that I first made the acquaintance
    of the late Admiral Lord Beresford, then Commander
    Lord Charles Beresford, commanding the gun-vessel <i>Condor</i>. A sailing schooner, the yacht <i>Aline</i>, that had
    been lent to Lord Charles by the Prince of Wales, was
    converted into a sort of tender to the <i>Condor</i>. Lady
    Charles was living on board, and, with their usual
    hospitality, the Beresfords constantly took their
    friends for sailing expeditions in the vicinity of the
    island.</p>
<p>Shortly after my arrival the squadron proceeded for
    the usual summer cruise. We made up a squadron
    of from six to eight big ships&mdash;a very convenient
    number for man&#339;uvring, and my Captain being one
    of the Seniors on the Station, the <i>Superb</i> was very
    generally leader of the lee line, as the second division
    was still called, in memory of the old sailing-ship days.
    This particular summer cruise was a very interesting
    one, for it included a visit to the Dalmatian coast. I
    have several times visited the Dalmatian coast since,
    and I have always wondered how any one, who could
    afford the luxury of a yacht, did not make a point of
    making the Adriatic the main objective of his Mediter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>ranean
    cruise. It really is a most enchanting part of
    the world, and the pleasantest way of visiting it, is from
    the sea, beginning at Venice and working steadily down
    the coast to Corfu. Apart from the absorbing interest
    there is in seeing one civilisation literally on the top of
    another, as is exemplified in the Palace of Diocletian,
    which now is practically turned into the fair-sized town
    of Spalato, all down the coast it is easy to see that
    Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Hungarians, Genoese,
    and, above all, Venetians, have, in their turn, left the
    impress of their various civilisations. In addition,
    the beauty of some of the harbours is quite beyond
    my powers of description. Cattaro, one of the
    most important, is perhaps also the finest as regards
    scenery. Approaching it from the sea, the ship has to
    pass through the narrow winding entrance known as
    &ldquo;le Bocche.&rdquo; On either side, in addition to the
    modern fortifications constructed by the Austrians, the
    remains of ancient bastions and most picturesque little
    villages meet the eye. Finally, the great harbour is
    reached. Surrounded by precipitous mountains, it is
    completely landlocked, and there is anchorage there for
    half the war fleets of Europe. At the head of the
    bay is the town of Cattaro. Perched, as it is, on the
    side of a steep hill, surrounded by high walls with
    occasional towers, so thoroughly mediæval is it still,
    that it looks like the background of one of Doré&rsquo;s
    fantastic illustrations of the <i>Contes Drolatiques</i>. Corfu,
    too, is lovely. The view over the harbour, with
    Ulysses Island and the old Venetian fortress as a foreground,
    the bay, with its islands as a middle distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> and the Albanian Mountains as a background, forms a
    picture that is quite unforgettable.</p>
<p>But to return to our cruise. Off Venice the heavy
    ships of the squadron were anchored at Malamocco,
    which, just outside the canals, is some considerable
    distance from the town of Venice, but on a summer&rsquo;s
    night it was not an unpleasant thing to return in what
    was called a &ldquo;four-horse&rdquo; gondola in the early hours
    of the morning. Pola, the headquarters of the Austro-Hungarian
    Navy, was one of our ports of call, and the
    visit was quite an enjoyable one; the Austrian Naval
    Officers were very civil and hospitable, and their Commander-in-Chief
    at that time was a man who had been
    Flag-Lieutenant to Admiral Tegethoff at the battle of
    Lissa. In conversation with Austrian Naval Officers it
    was possible to appreciate some of the difficulties of
    that patchwork Empire. For instance, so mixed were
    the nationalities of their men-of-war crews that it was
    necessary for an officer to be able to speak to his men
    in at least four different languages&mdash;Czech, Slav,
    Italian, and German; small wonder that, owing to the
    stress of the late war and the complete victory of the
    Allies, what was the Austro-Hungarian Empire is now
    completely disintegrated.</p>
<p>At Trieste I made the acquaintance of two very
    interesting people, Sir Richard and Lady Burton. He
    was then British Consul there. The British Consular
    Service has always been woefully starved, the result
    being that, as a general rule, a number of very ill-paid
    posts are filled up by small local purveyors, who find
    it worth while to fly the Union Jack over their place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> of business; but at Trieste, at any rate, two men of
    great distinction were Consuls during my lifetime, one
    being Charles Lever the novelist, and the other Sir
    Richard Burton, the great explorer and Oriental scholar
    and writer.</p>
<p>The Fleet worked its way steadily down the
    Dalmatian coast, calling at Zara, Sebenico, Ragusa,
    Spalato, Cattaro, and, to my taste, not staying nearly long
    enough at any of these interesting places, the reason
    being, I suppose, that we were there for Fleet exercises
    and man&#339;uvres, and not for sight-seeing. Sir Beauchamp,
    however, did go himself for one inland trip
    from Cattaro. He drove to Cettigne, on a short visit
    to call on the Prince of Montenegro. From what he
    told me some time after I do not think that he was
    much impressed either with this reigning princelet or
    with what he described as his &ldquo;little <i>bicoque</i>&rdquo; of a
    royal residence. After a short stay at Cattaro, the
    Fleet proceeded to Corfu, where it remained for some
    time. The <i>Aline</i> was still in attendance on the <i>Condor</i>,
    and many were the pleasant afternoons spent on board
    of her, sailing about that beautiful bay. After Corfu,
    the Fleet proceeded to Eastern waters, visiting countless
    islands of the Greek Archipelago of surpassing beauty.
    In that part of the world it may truthfully be said, that,
    &ldquo;only man is vile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The winter was passed mainly at Malta, but the <i>Superb</i> was privileged to go on an independent cruise to
    the Coast of Syria, and we passed the greater part of the
    month in that paradise of the sportsman. Ayas Bay
    was our headquarters. It is conveniently situated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> the Gulf of Alexandretta, or Iskanderun as it is called by
    the Turks. It has a good anchorage for big ships, so
    the <i>Superb</i> could, and did, lay there very comfortably.
    We officers divided ourselves into two parties, taking our
    leave in turn&mdash;one party remained on board the ship
    and did perpetual duty, while the members of the other,
    camped out about twenty miles inland and shot to their
    hearts&rsquo; content. We organised a small camel transport
    to carry our tents and general camp equipment, and
    hired ponies for our own use. The first detachment
    rode away and established the camp, and at the end of
    the week left the camp standing, rode back to the ship
    to relieve those on duty, who, taking the ponies, went
    back inland for their turn of sport. Game abounded;
    francolin, woodcock and every sort of wild fowl, formed
    the greater part of the bag, and although we were a
    very moderate lot of shots we really amassed altogether
    quite a respectable total&mdash;enough to give both officers
    and men a welcome change of diet. It was at Ayas,
    too, that I first made the acquaintance of the late Lord
    Kitchener. He was then a young Engineer Officer
    employed by the Foreign Office as one of their Intelligence
    Officers in the Euphrates Valley district. He
    came on board the ship on her arrival, and helped us
    to organise the camel transport that was necessary for
    our shooting expedition. Many years afterwards, it
    was my fate to see him organising transport of a very
    different kind, and on an enormous scale, for the
    advance of the British Army on Pretoria during the
    South African War.</p>
<p>Altogether we had a delightful time at Ayas. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> climate was divine. Although it was mid-winter there
    was brilliant sunshine all day, with a wonderfully
    bracing air. The nights were very chill, but under
    canvas, with plenty of blankets, the cold was rather
    pleasant than otherwise. The rest of that really
    delightful winter was spent at Malta. There was plenty
    of pony racing, and I was lucky enough to ride a winner
    belonging to a very old friend and messmate on board
    the <i>Superb</i>, the present Admiral Sir Charles Graves
    Sawle, one of his ponies having, in my hands, won the
    hurdle race at the Spring Meeting.</p>
<p>But this peaceful time was rapidly coming to an end.
    In the spring of 1882 things in Egypt were evidently
    going from bad to worse, so in May the Fleet was
    ordered to cruise in the neighbourhood of Alexandria,
    and off that port the bulk of the Fleet patrolled backwards
    and forwards for weeks whilst the members of
    the Government were trying (very slowly, it seemed to
    us!) to make up their minds as to what steps should be
    taken. Early in June the Fleet was ordered to enter
    the port of Alexandria, the heavier ships&mdash;<i>Alexandra</i>, <i>Superb</i>, <i>Sultan</i>, <i>Temeraire</i>, <i>Inflexible</i>&mdash;anchoring outside,
    while the inside squadron consisted of ships of lighter
    draught&mdash;the <i>Penelope</i> and <i>Monarch</i> joined up with the <i>Invincible</i>, the temporary flagship of Sir Beauchamp
    Seymour, who had been there since the middle of May.
    The smaller craft attached to the Fleet consisted of the <i>Hecla</i>, a torpedo depot vessel, the gun-vessels and gunboats, <i>Condor</i>, <i>Bittern</i>, <i>Beacon</i>, <i>Cygnet</i>, <i>Decoy</i>, and the
    dispatch vessel <i>Helicon</i>.</p>
<p>It is none of my business to comment on the situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> at that time in Egypt, but probably every reasonable
    man would now agree with Lord Salisbury, who, when
    exposing the vacillating policy which the Government
    exhibited for weeks and months, instanced as a direct
    result that the massacre of Alexandria which took place
    on June 11th,&mdash;(of which I was a spectator and will
    chronicle more anon),&mdash;amounted, amongst other details,
    to British subjects being &ldquo;butchered under the very
    guns of the Fleet, which had never budged an inch to
    save them.&rdquo; But, after all, nothing more can be expected
    of the &ldquo;great Parliamentarian,&rdquo;&mdash;and I imagine
    that not even the most bigoted of Tories would grudge
    the late Mr. Gladstone that measure of compliment.
    I also suppose that no man but a politician of Mr.
    Gladstone&rsquo;s commanding intellect and reputation could
    inform Parliament, a fortnight after Alexandria had
    been bombarded and when some 40,000 troops were on
    their way to Egypt, that the country &ldquo;was not at war.&rdquo;
    But, as I remarked in my Introduction, &ldquo;I love an
    Artist,&rdquo; and surely no greater political artist ever
    flourished than the man we still hear spoken of with
    such love and veneration as &ldquo;Mr. G.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Sunday, the 11th of June, the situation apparently
    remaining fairly quiet, leave was given to officers and
    chief petty officers, and, cooped up as we had all been
    when cruising off Alexandria, nearly every one not
    required for duty took the opportunity of going ashore.
    I was one of those who landed, and I cannot better
    describe what I saw of the events of that day than by
    inserting a copy of a letter which I wrote at the time
    to my brother, then Viscount Ebrington, M.P. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> letter was probably the earliest account received by
    post, and when shown to Sir Charles Dilke, the then
    Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, was, by
    his wish, forwarded to <i>The Times</i>, which duly published
    it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Massacre at Alexandria.</span></p>
    <p>&ldquo;The following private letter has been received from an
        officer in the Fleet:&mdash;</p>
    <p class="sign"> &ldquo;<i>Off Alexandria, June 16th, 1882.</i> </p>
    <p>&ldquo;My dear &mdash;&mdash;, . . . We are dwelling in the midst of alarms,
        with our loins girded, etc., all ready to knock down forts and
        otherwise protect British interests. That was a deuce of a
        row last Sunday, and we were all precious lucky to get back to
        the ship alive. I fancy the row was arranged by Arabi, so that
        he could have the pleasure of putting it down; but, like every
        other row, it had to have some <i>raison d&rsquo;être</i>, and this was easily
        found in a squabble between some Arabs and Greeks. The
        Arabs began to break windows, and the Greeks produced firearms,
        and let fly amongst them. I was in the same street
        about a couple of hundred yards off, and saw the stones flying
        and the shooting; but though there were Arabs all about us,
        they never made an attempt to annoy us in any way.
        Presently up came some troops, all anyhow, without a single
        officer, and began to blaze away with great impartiality; but it
        struck us all that for choice they went for the Europeans. We,
        being between the bulk of the mob and the troops, and seeing
        people beginning to drop, thought, on the whole, we were not
        very happily placed, and having by the blessing of Providence
        found ourselves near a door, executed a strategic movement
        to the left, got inside the door, and locked it. The house we
        got into turned out to be a sort of monastery school, and there
        we remained for over an hour. Meanwhile, outside the fun
        was becoming decidedly fast and furious. The soldiers pegged
        away merrily, and the Arabs looted. We could see them
        through the shutters carrying off all sorts of trash&mdash;toys, chairs,
        baths (and what could an Arab do with a bath?)&mdash;in fact,
        anything they could lay hands on. Presently, the soldiers having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> evidently got our part of the town into something like order,
        we strolled out trying to look as if we were not in a funk, and
        in fact rather liked it. My friend and I were just getting into
        a trap to drive down to the landing-place, when an Egyptian
        policeman, who could speak English, came up and told us it
        was certain death to drive down where we were going, as the
        mob were at their worst there, and were hauling the people
        out of the cabs and cutting their throats. We at once came
        to the conclusion that we would give up our drive, and went to
        the nearest consulate, where we waited till the disturbance was
        over.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;All this was child&rsquo;s play compared to what happened to
        another lot. About half an hour before we got to the consulate
        four of our fellows&mdash;a great friend of mine (S.), a little Swede we
        are educating on board here, one of our doctors and an engineer
        got into a cab, and proceeded to drive down. All of a sudden
        they were surrounded by a mob of Arabs, who stopped the
        horses and went for them with their sticks. Being, of course,
        completely unarmed, they ran&mdash;S. and the Swede on one side,
        and the doctor and engineer the other. Dear old S., having
        been rather a professor at football in the days of his youth, being
        very strong and quick on his pins, and the little Swede also
        being as hard as nails, they managed to get through the brutes,
        with no injury except a good hammering all over. Of the
        others, one was stabbed and beaten to death, and the other,
        who is still in bed, after being beaten most frightfully, managed
        to crawl up to a soldier, who, for a wonder, behaved like a
        trump, stood over him with a fixed bayonet, and finally shoved
        him into a house, where he stopped all night, and was fetched
        on board next day, poor chap, in a most pitiable condition.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;And now comes the most extraordinary thing of all. One
        of our chief petty officers was ashore on leave. Our poor
        engineer was picked up by another trap going the other way,
        and was taken to the police-station. As he was being helped
        out of the trap, another Arab came up, banged him over the
        head and knocked him down. The petty officer went for
        the beast with a common thorn walking-stick he had in his
        hand, jammed it into his mouth with such force that it came
        out behind the ear, and killed him dead. There certainly is a
        Providence watching over sailors, because this fellow was hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> touched. When he came on board and said that he had killed
        his Arab, as before described, nobody believed him. However,
        it turned out to be absolutely true.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The telegrams will have told you more than we know
        about the numbers killed, but there is no doubt that they
        finished off at least sixty Europeans, and Heaven only knows
        how many Arabs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nowadays there are few Englishmen who have not
    served in the Army or Navy in some capacity, so they
    will be able to appreciate how the month dragged its
    weary way along from the 11th of June to the 11th
    of July, when at last we were permitted to &ldquo;get a little of
    our own back&rdquo; by bombarding the forts. Meanwhile we
    had fretted and raged at the idea, of Englishmen, many
    of whom were officers in the Navy, being treated like
    dogs by a lot of half-naked Arabs, and that we, though
    on the spot and serving in a powerful Fleet, were not
    allowed to retaliate. I have never witnessed such discontent
    as existed, and certainly on board my own ship
    the cases of men refusing to obey orders became
    commoner every day; but while the officers and men
    of the Service suffered, they could expect no sympathy
    from the gentlemen of the House of Commons for
    anything so ordinary as the ill-treatment of British
    subjects. Among the members of that House of
    Parliament there are always men who have no enemies
    in the world except their own countrymen, and the
    rest of them are engaged in that most amusing and
    engrossing sport known as &ldquo;Politics.&rdquo; Anything outside
    the region of political exigencies matters nothing to
    them. I have the opinion of one of the ablest of them that
    ever lived in support of this theory. Years ago I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> travelling back from a race meeting with Lord Randolph
    Churchill, and I well remember his conversation. He
    told me he had tried most things in the shape of excitement.
    He admitted that big game shooting was
    excellent fun, that engineering a successful coup on
    the Turf (and he and his racing partner, Lord Dunraven,
    had lately pulled off a remarkably successful coup
    when that good mare l&rsquo;Abbesse de Jouarre won a great
    handicap) was enthralling; but he went on to say that
    nothing in the world was half so engrossing, as were the
    almost daily intrigues and man&#339;uvres that formed the
    meat and drink of the politician. But this is a digression,
    and I must return to Alexandria.</p>
<p>During the ensuing month Alexandria was being
    rapidly deserted, and an enormous number of refugees
    of all nations were being deported as rapidly as
    possible to their homes. Commander Lord Charles
    Beresford was placed in charge, and the work of chartering
    ships for the embarkation of passengers was no
    light one. So far as the <i>Superb</i> was concerned, our
    first duty, after the massacre, was to embark a number
    of corpses, one being that of our own engineer officer.
    Many others were those of men in the Fleet. We
    had to take them out to sea, and, in the words of our
    Burial Service, commit them to the deep. Bluejackets
    have not the smallest objection to seeing their comrades
    buried at sea when there are obvious reasons for so
    doing, but they bitterly resented being sent to sea to
    bury their dead when there was a Christian churchyard
    ashore, and this was another cause of much of the discontent
    of which I have spoken. Mercifully, things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> in England were improving. Public indignation forced
    the Government reluctantly to take action, and the
    Admiral was allowed to send an ultimatum, which I
    believe was principally to the effect that if the work of
    strengthening the coast fortifications still proceeded the
    Fleet would bombard and destroy the forts. Arabi
    replied by bringing more troops to Alexandria and
    continued to labour on the coast defences, so at last,
    on July 10th, all merchant ships and foreign men-of-war
    were ordered out of the harbour, and at 6 a.m.,
    July 11th, the bombardment began.</p>
<p>I am not proposing to write any sort of description
    of the bombardment as a whole, but am simply relating
    what came under my personal observation as a lieutenant
    commanding a battery on board the <i>Superb</i>.
    The <i>Superb</i> mounted twelve 18-ton muzzle-loading
    10-inch guns in her main battery. My old comrade,
    the above-mentioned Lieutenant Charles Graves Sawle,
    commanded the six guns that were mounted on one
    side, and I commanded the other six. There were
    then no hydraulic lifts or mechanical appliances of any
    sort, so what really happened in action was that the
    side that was unengaged hoisted the shell up by hand
    from the bowels of the ship, and the engaged battery
    fired them off. My own battery was terribly under-officered
    when my side was in action. To assist me to
    control the firing of six 400-pounders (to revert to the
    old-fashioned measurement) I had only one subaltern
    of marines and one midshipman. It may be imagined
    how difficult it was to give orders and exercise control
    with something like a hundred men rushing projectiles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> up from the shell-room on one side, while the guns
    on my engaged side were in action with all the accompanying
    noise of firing and the clanking of chains
    and winches for the process of training and loading the
    guns. After some rather wild shooting at the commencement,
    when the men, owing to their keenness,
    were difficult to restrain, we settled down steadily to
    work, and at last we were able to appreciate by actual
    practice how scandalous was the sighting of our guns;
    how poor their shooting capacity, and how faulty their
    projectiles. Ten years before Alexandria, the French
    Navy possessed a breech-loading heavy gun, working
    on the same principle as does our gun of to-day; but
    owing, I believe, to the wiseacres at Woolwich at the
    time of which I write, our guns were provided for us
    by soldiers, and the Navy was condemned to go on
    with these ridiculous muzzle-loaders.</p>
<p>The first part of the bombardment was carried out
    by the outside squadron under weigh, but we soon
    found that, when moving, it was impossible to make,
    with our weapons, any sort of accurate shooting, so the
    squadron was anchored. Luckily for us, the Egyptian
    guns were practically just as faulty as our own, their
    ammunition was a great deal worse, and their shooting
    beneath contempt, so the damage done to the fleet was
    very slight, and the casualties were trifling. After a
    long day&rsquo;s firing the Egyptians were driven away from
    their guns, and a considerable amount of damage was
    done to the forts. One lucky shot from the <i>Superb&rsquo;s</i> battery set fire to the magazine of Fort Adah, which
    we were then engaging, and blew it up, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> brought the day to a conclusion as far as my ship was
    concerned.</p>
<p>Although the Egyptians had been driven from their
    guns, their powers for mischief had by no means come
    to an end, and the very next day the town of
    Alexandria was set on fire and looted. The Khedive
    being in considerable danger in his palace at Ramleh,
    he was safely moved to another palace at Ras el Tin,
    situated on the peninsula of that name, which had been
    occupied by a landing-party of bluejackets and marines,
    and a few days afterwards I was landed in command of
    a company of bluejackets to form part of the garrison
    of Ras el Tin, our duty being to ensure the safety of
    the Khedive. Like all sailors, we were delighted to
    get out of the ship, but I do not know that we were
    much better off than our brother officers who were left
    on board. It sounded very Oriental and romantic to
    be quartered in a harem, but as the harem was very
    stuffy and dirty, and only inhabited by swarms of flies,
    it did not quite come up to my ideas of Eastern
    luxury.</p>
<p>But events were beginning to move&mdash;the fires in
    Alexandria were gradually got under, and order had
    been restored to the town by the unceasing exertions
    of Lord Charles Beresford. He began his work ashore
    with only 140 men under him, bluejackets and
    marines, who, to use his own words, &ldquo;had to patrol
    the town, stop the looting, stop the fresh burning of
    houses, bury the corpses, and protect the lives of those
    who had come on shore.&rdquo; His force was subsequently
    increased by 600 marines, and they were assisted by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> mixed force of Americans, Germans, Greeks, and
    Italians. Moreover, for cleaning-up purposes, he
    succeeded in hiring Arab labour. By the 21st all the
    fires were out and the city was beginning to reassume
    its normal shape, and on the 1st August he was able
    to turn over his post as Provost-Marshal and Chief-of-Police
    at Alexandria to the Military Authorities and
    return to his ship.</p>
<p>The late Admiral Lord Beresford did much good
    service for his country in many capacities and for many
    years; but I greatly doubt whether he ever performed
    a much finer piece of work than when Chief-of-Police
    at Alexandria.</p>
<p>Soon, troops began to pour into Egypt. On the
    17th between 2000 and 3000 were landed under the
    command of General Sir Archibald Alison, and shortly
    afterwards all the sailors ashore were relieved by
    soldiers. By the 15th August, when the General
    Commander-in-Chief, Sir Garnet Wolseley, arrived,
    the bulk of his army, some 40,000 men, were either
    landed in Egypt or else on board transports at
    Alexandria. Sir Garnet was, without any doubt, one
    of the ablest soldiers this country has produced since
    the days of Wellington, and nobody knew better than
    he how to disseminate false information that was sure
    to trickle through and deceive the enemy.</p>
<p>On the 18th August the <i>Superb</i> received orders to
    form part of an escorting squadron of iron-clads,
    destined to shepherd the transports to some destination,
    name unknown. Gradually a whisper went
    round that Aboukir Bay was to be the jumping-off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> place for the invasion of Egypt. It was rumoured
    that Sir Garnet had confided the fact to one man,&mdash;it
    was not quite sure whether the man was his Chief of
    the Staff or an influential Pressman. As to this,
    opinions differed. Anyhow, the one man in question
    had been told under the seal of profound secrecy that
    Aboukir was the destination of the transports. He
    must have babbled in his sleep, for obviously he would
    not knowingly have betrayed the confidence of the
    Commander-in-Chief, but however it might have been,
    the rumour spread, and many hours before we started
    there was not a soul on board the combined fleet of
    iron-clads and transports who was not thoroughly convinced
    that we were going to Aboukir. The night
    before we started I succeeded in collecting three of my
    brothers, who were serving at the time, to dine with
    me on board my ship. One, subsequently killed at
    Diamond Hill, outside Pretoria, in the South African
    Campaign, was on leave from his regiment, the 17th
    Lancers, from India, and was trying to get the
    Military Authorities in Cairo to give him a temporary
    job; the second was in the Coldstream Guards, and
    was on board one of the transports that was under our
    charge, and anchored close by, he died in 1895;
    and the third, then a Midshipman in the <i>Carysfort</i>,
    was fated to be drowned a few years later, when a Sub-Lieutenant
    on the gunboat <i>Wasp</i>, that went down in
    the China Seas with all hands, and was never heard of
    again. I rather doubt whether we four brothers had
    ever been all together before, but we certainly never
    met all together again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<p>The next morning the transports and their convoy
    weighed, and proceeded to Aboukir, and a very
    imposing spectacle they made. Each iron-clad was in
    charge of three large transports, by which means quite
    respectable station could be kept, and, unlike most
    convoys, there were no stragglers.</p>
<p>Just before arriving at Aboukir Bay, as the Fleet
    was preparing to anchor and excitement was at its
    highest, a signal was made directing us all to steer on
    a certain course, and some hours later we found ourselves
    at the entrance to the Suez Canal, of which
    entire possession had been already taken by another
    portion of the Fleet. Suez had, meanwhile, been
    seized by Admiral Hewett. The transports were
    passed as rapidly through the canal as possible, with
    the view of disembarking their troops at Ismailia, and
    we remained in masterly inactivity off Port Said.</p>
<p>It was at that time that I suffered one of the greatest
    disappointments in my life, and I can still recall the
    absolute tears of rage and mortification that I shed.
    A night or two after our arrival at Port Said, unluckily
    for me, I had kept the middle watch, from midnight
    until 4 a.m. Very shortly after 4 a.m. a signal was
    made to the ships in harbour to land a Naval Brigade
    for service at the front, the force to be ready to start
    in two hours&rsquo; time. The officer of the morning watch
    took the signal to the Captain, who at once gave the
    necessary orders. By right of seniority I should have
    been selected, but when the Captain was informed that
    I had just turned in after night duty, he decided not
    to disturb me and sent a lieutenant who was my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> junior instead. When I appeared next morning, about
    eight, I was told the news, and I fairly tore my hair
    out with vexation. I insisted on seeing the Captain,
    and he quite agreed that, without meaning any harm,
    he had treated me badly; but no reparation was possible,
    for it was too late, the Naval Brigade being already
    some miles up the Canal in the tug that was conveying
    them. Philosophy does sometimes fail to bring
    comfort, and mine for the moment became a negligible
    quantity. I did succeed in getting up to Cairo a little later
    for a short time, after its occupation by the British troops,
    but in the days of one&rsquo;s youth it seemed a bitter disappointment
    not to have been at Tel-el-Kebir, and not to
    have marched into Cairo as part of the victorious army.</p>
<p>The <i>Superb&rsquo;s</i> portion of this Naval Brigade was
    landed in such haste that nothing had been provided
    for the officers and men of the force in the way of
    camp equipment, not so much as a kettle. When
    they arrived at the front the Chief Petty Officer
    reported this fact to the Lieutenant in command, and
    they put their heads together as to what steps to take.
    The C.P.O. was an old warrior who had served in
    the Naval Brigade at Perak, so by his advice the officer
    made himself scarce for an hour or two, and when he
    returned he found all things in readiness for supper,
    a large kettle swinging over the fire, and a general air
    of comfort. He subsequently asked his C.P.O. how
    he managed to provide all these necessaries, and this
    was the answer: &ldquo;Well, sir, I don&rsquo;t exactly know,
    but I <i>do</i> hear that there is a . . . row in the Scots
    Guards Camp!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>
<h3>FROM GALATZ TO SOUAKIM VIA LONDON</h3>
<p>Shortly after the return of the Fleet to Malta,
    Sir Beauchamp Seymour, who had been created Lord
    Alcester for his services in Egypt, returned to England,
    Vice-Admiral Lord John Hay having arrived to take
    over the Mediterranean Station as Commander-in-Chief,
    hoisting his flag in the <i>Alexandra</i>, with Captain
    Harry Rawson for his Flag-Captain and the Honourable
    Hugh Tyrrwhitt as Flag-Lieutenant. Hugh Tyrrwhitt,
    who had been in the <i>Britannia</i> during my time there,
    was one of my greatest friends. Alas! he died in
    1907, and his death brought an untimely end to
    what was already a distinguished career in the Navy.
    Shortly before his death, when still only of the rank
    of Captain, he had been offered the Indian Command;
    ill-health compelled him to decline it, and he died
    shortly afterwards on board a steamer on his way
    to Egypt, to which country he had been ordered by
    his doctors. As a Captain he had held some very
    important posts, having been in turn Flag-Captain
    to Sir John Fisher, when Commander-in-Chief in the
    Mediterranean; had commanded the <i>Renown</i> when
    the present King paid a visit to India as Prince of
    Wales, and was subsequently Naval Private Secretary
    to Lord Cawdor when First Lord of the Admiralty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> Lord Cawdor brought his great experience of business
    (he had been a most successful Chairman of the Board
    of the Great Western Railway) to the service of his
    country, and was generally acknowledged, at any rate
    by the Navy, to have been one of the very best First
    Lords of his generation. He was far from being
    an advertising politician; but with his sound judgment
    and his great administrative capacity, his death was
    none the less a great loss to England. During his
    reign at the Admiralty it was several times my good
    fortune to meet him at little dinners given by Hugh
    Tyrrwhitt, at which Sir John Fisher and I were the
    other guests, and the amount of naval &ldquo;shop&rdquo; that
    was discussed in the course of one of these pleasant
    evenings is more easily imagined than described.</p>
<p>The rest of my time in the <i>Superb</i> was uneventful
    enough, and we were all beginning to look forward
    to paying off and a little leave in England, when my
    personal plans were completely changed by the arrival
    of a very small craft, the <i>Cockatrice</i> by name, at Malta.
    This curious little river vessel had left her station
    up the Danube for a refit at Malta, and her first and
    only lieutenant having been invalided, the vacancy
    thus occurring was offered to me. I was rather
    curious to see something of the Balkan States, and
    anyhow it meant a very pleasant winter at Malta with
    only a tiny river craft to look after, instead of being
    a hard-worked watch-keeper on board an iron-clad.
    I was quite right about the winter at Malta; it
    was a very pleasant one. There happened to be
    some particularly nice visitors at Valetta, any work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> connected with the repairs that were being executed
    by the Dockyard was easily got over in the forenoon,
    after which time I was as free as air, and ready to
    take part in anything going on that was likely to
    be amusing, whether ashore or afloat, for, having
    hired a little cutter yacht, I could take small parties
    round by sail to picnic at some of the interesting
    places outside the harbour, and, moreover, during
    that particular winter, the Opera Company was well
    above the average.</p>
<p>In the spring the <i>Cockatrice</i> had to get round to
    her headquarters on the Danube where she represented
    Great Britain on the Danube Commission.
    This Commission was a legacy from the Treaty of
    Paris, all the Signatory Powers having agreed to be
    represented by a <i>stationnaire</i> of some sort up the
    river, their main object being to see that the Russians
    did not divert the course of the stream, so that large
    steamers would be compelled to use the St. George&rsquo;s
    mouths which emptied themselves into the Black
    Sea in Russian territory, instead of the Kilia mouths
    which debouched at Sulina.</p>
<p>A voyage from Malta to Constantinople was quite
    a serious undertaking for the little <i>Cockatrice</i>. So near
    the water were our scuttles (as the small windows
    which give light and air are called on board a man-of-war)
    that even up a river it was generally necessary
    to keep them closed, as the smallest ripple would
    splash water into them. This is only mentioned to
    give an idea of how unseaworthy a craft she was,
    and no blame to any one, as she was entirely designed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> for river service. The elements were kind, and we
    never encountered anything more serious than a fresh
    breeze, and arrived at our first port of call, Constantinople,
    without a mishap of any kind. The <i>Cockatrice</i> was well known at Constantinople, as she
    went there regularly for a refit every year,&mdash;it was
    only on very rare occasions that she went to Malta.
    Our little ship was anchored at Kadikoi, which is over
    on the Asiatic side, and I was quickly introduced by
    my messmates to the pleasant Levantine Society that
    is the feature of that neighbourhood, and is so
    well described by Claude Farrère in <i>L&rsquo;Homme qui
    Assassina</i>. We were most hospitably entertained
    by the occupants of the numerous villas, and the
    time passed very agreeably. Indeed, I found Kadikoi
    such a pleasant place that I believe I only once troubled
    to go over to Pera, and that was to attend a ball
    which was given at our Embassy and to which it
    was rather a matter of duty to go. I found diplomatic
    society, however exalted it might be, with &ldquo;their
    Excellencies&rdquo; and their &ldquo;<i>chers collègues</i>&rdquo; (for apparently
    not even the humblest member of a small Legation,
    is ever alluded to by a member of any other Legation,
    or Embassy, in any terms other than &ldquo;Mon cher
    collègue&rdquo;), very dull as compared with some of the
    humbler, but sometimes exceedingly attractive inhabitants
    of Kadikoi.</p>
<p>Our next move was through the Bosphorus, perhaps
    the most beautiful strait in the world, and up the
    Black Sea to Sulina, and thence up the river to
    Galatz, where we duly tied ourselves up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> re-assumed our business as one of the line of <i>stationnaires</i> of the Signatory Powers.</p>
<p>The Danube, even as high up as Galatz, is certainly
    an imposing stream and is still some three or four
    miles in breadth. It was there that a large portion
    of the Russian Army crossed in the 1877-8 campaign,
    and a difficult operation it must have been. For
    the rest, it is only necessary to say that the town is,
    or was, thoroughly Oriental. One of the main roads
    ran parallel to the river bank, close to where we were
    secured, and to give an instance of the extreme
    Orientalism existing there, the following is a typical
    example. It used to interest us much to watch the
    numerous carts that passed along that thoroughfare,
    one and all in turn subsiding into an enormous hole
    in the road, day after day and month after month,
    for the simple reason that it never occurred to the
    Eastern mind to fill the hole up. The mosquitoes
    up the Danube have to be experienced to be realised,
    but their attentions were discounted by our mode
    of life, which consisted mainly in sleeping a considerable
    portion of the day and sitting up the greater part
    of the night. There was a small, but very hospitable,
    colony of English merchants there, and it became
    the invariable custom for a number of them to lunch
    on board every day. This was convenient, as the <i>Cockatrice</i> lay close to their places of business. After
    this early luncheon we used to drive up to their
    villas, which were situated on the further outskirts
    of the town, and there we settled down for the rest
    of the day. A prolonged siesta was the first opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>tion;
    a large, cool, dark room being infinitely preferable
    for that purpose than the stuffy little cabins on board
    the ship. After the siesta there would be a couple
    of hours strenuous lawn-tennis, then a very late
    dinner, and finally a prolonged visit to one of the
    music-halls of the town, which began their evening&rsquo;s
    business about 11 p.m. and did not bring it to an
    end until any hour in the morning, and finally back
    to the ship for two or three hours&rsquo; sleep before the
    &ldquo;labours&rdquo; of the next day began.</p>
<p>While stationed at Galatz I took the opportunity of
    visiting Bucharest. I have never been there since;
    but in those days it was a most attractive little capital,
    somewhat like Brussels in appearance, with charming
    shady boulevards. There was an excellent hotel, and
    I was fortunate in being able to make the acquaintance
    of Mr. and Mrs. White, he being then our Consul-General
    there. I was fated to meet him later when Sir
    William White, British Ambassador at Constantinople.
    During his long tenure of office in the Turkish capital
    he succeeded in raising British prestige, which had
    woefully declined for some years, to a higher level
    than it probably had attained since the days of Lord
    Stratford de Redcliffe, the great Eltchi.</p>
<p>To spend a few months up the Danube was
    interesting enough, but life there soon began to get
    wearisome and unprofitable from a professional point
    of view, so I proceeded to cast about for a change.
    The only way that suggested itself was to apply to
    the Admiralty for permission to return to England,
    with the object of going through the long course at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> Greenwich and Portsmouth, necessary for qualifying
    as a Gunnery Lieutenant. My Captain was good
    enough to support my application, so in the autumn
    of 1883 I found myself back at Greenwich again as
    one of a class of about a dozen lieutenants who were
    aspiring to become gunnery experts. I soon found
    out that I had mistaken my new profession. Most of
    my comrades were comparatively fresh from school,
    having only been at sea for one year, whereas I had
    five years&rsquo; service to my credit. I found that, after
    my long absence from anything in the way of school-work,
    high mathematics were no joke, and it seemed
    probable that when the examination time came, after
    labouring very hard at very uncongenial work, I should
    inevitably find myself at the bottom of my class.
    Consequently, I candidly admit that I was looking
    about for some fresh job all the time I was at Greenwich.
    Meanwhile, London was close by, and, feeling
    pretty sure that I should never get to the examination
    stage, I spent most of my time there, and only turned
    up at Greenwich for the lectures I was bound to attend.</p>
<p>One way and another I spent a very pleasant winter,
    and a good deal of it was passed at a very amusing
    little club that was established for a short time at
    87, St. James&rsquo;s Street, where whist was played for
    moderate points, and where, moreover, I met a
    number of very pleasant people. 87, St. James&rsquo;s Street
    was then a very curious house and stood on the site
    of the new post-office buildings. Mr. Tom Wallace,
    the well-known wine merchant, occupied the basement.
    He was a conspicuous figure in London, especially in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> St. James&rsquo;s Street, for he was in the habit of sitting
    in a chair on the pavement in front of his business
    premises, smoking his cigar there, and exchanging
    courtesies with his large circle of friends, who were
    almost sure to pass that particular corner at some time
    in the morning or early afternoon.</p>
<p>On the ground floor there was a Starting Price
    Betting Office, one of the very first of its kind to be
    inaugurated in London, and on the first floor was the
    Whist Club before alluded to. I was accused of
    assisting the members of that institution to sit up till
    unconscionable hours, for when it got very late (or
    rather very early in the morning) the most reasonable
    thing for me to do, seemed to consist in sitting up until
    the first train could convey me to Greenwich in time
    for a mathematical lecture, and, naturally, I was not
    anxious to sit up alone, and play patience!</p>
<p>It was there that I first made the acquaintance of a
    lifelong friend of mine, Mr. Cecil Clay. He was one
    of the sons of the well-known Major Clay, who was
    for many years Radical Member for Hull, and
    was counted as the greatest living authority of his day
    on the science of whist. His son Cecil was a worthy
    successor to him; not only a fine player, he was, as
    he still is, a delightful man both as a companion and
    one of the wittiest of raconteurs. In those days he
    lived in a charming little house in Park Street, where
    I have certainly been to the most amusing Sunday
    luncheon parties that I can remember. Hostess and
    host were both the perfection of courtesy and kindness,
    and all the cleverest and most agreeable people in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> dramatic profession were to be met there. I will
    mention only two of the habitués&mdash;who, alas! have
    both passed away, but were then young and bubbling
    over with wit and gaiety&mdash;Herbert Tree and Charles
    Brookfield. They were both constant guests, and
    those of my contemporaries who were fortunate enough
    to have met them in their irresponsible youth, will
    remember what a pleasure it was to be with them, and
    to take a part in all the clever chaff that used to pass
    between them. But, somehow, this amusing life in
    London did not amalgamate very well with high
    mathematics, and it became more and more evident to
    me that a change would be welcome.</p>
<p>In February 1885 it became necessary to send
    a large force to Souakim. For this large force
    adequate sea-transport was needed, and to my great
    good fortune, a staunch friend of mine, Captain John
    Fellowes (subsequently Admiral Sir John Fellowes)
    was selected as head of it. The Admiralty could not
    possibly have chosen a better man. He was full of
    resource, full of the wisdom of the serpent, was a
    glutton for work himself, and had the knack of
    extracting the last ounce of work out of his subordinates.
    I lost no time in going to him, and he at
    once applied to the Admiralty asking that I should be
    appointed as one of the transport officers to serve
    under him. My relative, Lord Alcester, was back at
    the Admiralty as First Sea Lord, and once more I had
    to interview him in his stronghold. This time he
    really was annoyed. He pointed out that in one year
    I had been something like six different kinds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> Lieutenants, that the Admiralty had had enough of
    me, and I really believe (kindest of men though he
    was) that his principal reason for acceding to my
    request, and Captain Fellowes&rsquo; application, was the
    vague chance that, in the Red Sea, a severe sunstroke
    might settle me and my business for ever.</p>
<p>Having obtained my point, I was in the seventh
    heaven of delight, and before carrying out the first
    order I received from the Admiralty, which was to go
    over to Kingstown, I went to pay a farewell visit to
    my friends at 87, St. James&rsquo;s Street. Tom Wallace,
    previously alluded to, assured me that he had made a
    close study of Egyptian warfare (I suppose from the
    strategic corner of St. James&rsquo;s Street and Pall Mall!),
    and that it was absolutely essential that any officer
    called on to serve in that trying climate should be
    suitably equipped in the way of wine. So the kind
    man fitted me out then and there with six dozen of
    excellent champagne and three dozen of remarkably
    sound port, on the understanding that if I came back
    I might pay for it at my leisure, and, if anything untoward
    happened, it obviously would not matter to me
    and very little to him. Another kind friend insisted
    on my standing in with him in a bet he had taken on
    a horse which was expected to win the Grand National,
    so I started for Ireland feeling that anyhow my
    campaigning kit would compare favourably with that
    of any one else, consolidated as it was by nine dozen
    of wine and a bet on the great Steeplechase.</p>
<p>Another farewell visit that I paid was to the Transport
    Department of the Admiralty, where I tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> glean some information about my duties. All I could
    get out of them was that, for the time being, I was
    appointed transport officer of the <i>Lydian Monarch</i>, a
    vessel that had been hired to convey a regiment of
    Lancers to Souakim or elsewhere, that I was to embark
    these troops at Kingstown, but when I tried to find
    out what authority was vested in me when on board a
    hired transport, nothing could I discover. In fact it
    was conveyed to me in a general way that my duties
    and responsibilities would <i>solvitur ambulando</i>, and with
    these vague directions I was obliged to be content.</p>
<p>To Kingstown I accordingly went in the night boat,
    and I must say that Ireland, which I was visiting for
    the first time, fully kept up its reputation for
    &ldquo;divarsion,&rdquo; for anything like the comicality of the
    scenes which I witnessed, when engaged next day in
    the embarkation of that distinguished Cavalry regiment,
    would need the pen of a Charles Lever to do them
    justice. On arriving on board the <i>Lydian Monarch</i> the first thing in the morning, I received a telegram
    from headquarters at Dublin, to the effect that a dismounted
    party would arrive from the barracks at 8 a.m.
    to make any further preparations which they might
    find necessary for the embarkation, and that the regiment
    would arrive about 11 a.m. About 9 a.m. the
    dismounted party arrived under the command of a
    very young subaltern. One of the first pieces of
    information of which I was in need, was whether the
    regiment was bringing lances or not. I had been told
    in London that they probably would not, but it was
    necessary to know, for they are very dangerous tools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span> on board a ship if not properly stowed. I well knew
    their propensities for getting in the way and putting
    people&rsquo;s eyes out from my personal acquaintance with
    that ancient weapon, the boarding pike, which was still
    part of our equipment on a man-of-war. When
    neither the youthful subaltern in charge of the party,
    nor any of the men under his command, could provide
    me with this very elementary piece of information, I
    began to fear the worst, and rather expected that the
    embarkation would be attended with some few
    difficulties. About three-quarters of an hour after the
    appointed time the regiment arrived, and if I, and the
    sailors of the <i>Lydian Monarch</i> rocked with laughing at
    seeing so many drunken men, it was nothing to the
    rocking that the Lancers were doing in their saddles
    before they had been successfully dismounted. Being
    convinced that nothing in the way of work was to be
    expected from the men of the regiment, I succeeded in
    borrowing a working party of bluejackets from the
    guardship to help tie up the horses, which is always
    rather a ticklish business. We got on famously with
    our work for some time, but, unfortunately, there was
    so much whisky about that the bluejackets were, very
    soon, all more or less drunk too. By this time the day
    was closing in, we were anxious to sail before dark, and
    the situation was not particularly promising. The
    Military Authorities in Dublin had meanwhile been
    told how things were <i>not</i> progressing, and presently the
    Commander-in-Chief in Dublin and his Staff arrived
    on the scene. Fortunately the horses were at last all on
    board (poor brutes! some of them had been standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> with their saddles off in the snow for hours, for, in
    addition to our other difficulties, there was some inches
    of snow on the ground), and the next thing was to
    discover where the men of the regiment were. It was
    rumoured that a good many of them had left the
    immediate vicinity of the ship, and had wandered off,
    still being thirsty, to the numerous public-houses in
    the neighbourhood. Mercifully, a trumpeter, who
    was fairly sober, could be produced, and presently a
    swaying line of dismounted Lancers formed itself on
    the quay opposite the ship. There were a good many
    absentees, but the Commander-in-Chief decided to send
    the ship to sea, so away we went, and, in justice to a
    very fine regiment, I may mention that eventually the
    so-called absentees were all found on board the ship.
    One of them, I remember, did not turn up for three
    days, he having been buried during the whole of that
    time under a heap of kit bags, and when rescued was
    very much more dead than alive from a combination
    of suffocation and sea-sickness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was a considerable clamour
    raised about what was described as a disgraceful scene,
    and the usual lurid descriptions were published of
    what really was a very trifling affair. The Commanding
    Officer had, perhaps, been a little over good-natured
    in letting his men out of barracks the night
    before they embarked, and very naturally the men
    had celebrated the occasion in the usual way. The
    rest was due to Irish hospitality, and to the sentiment
    that existed in those days in an Irish mob (a
    sentiment which, alas! owing to politicians of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> kinds, exists no longer)&mdash;the love of the Irish for a
    soldier, especially if he happened to be an Irish
    cavalryman.</p>
<p>By way of making the story of the embarkation
    more sensational still, some enterprising Dublin
    journalist calmly took upon himself to sink the <i>Lydian Monarch</i> with all hands a few hours afterwards
    in the Irish Channel, and, as it did happen
    to blow very heavily at the time, a good deal of
    pain and anxiety was caused to those who had relatives
    and friends on board her. However, this lie
    was contradicted pretty soon, and we had the pleasure,
    on arriving at Souakim, of hearing that the delinquent
    had been imprisoned for circulating a mischievous
    story for which there was no foundation. We, out
    there, thought that hanging was much too good for
    him; but on reflection it was probably only a sense
    of dramatic fitness that impelled him to start the
    rumour, and, moreover, people have no right to believe
    any sort of rumour when a war is on, not more than
    one in a hundred being ever well founded.</p>
<p>We had hardly got fairly started on our journey
    before we picked up a real gale in the Channel, and
    I very soon discovered what fine material there was
    in the regiment. The ship was rolling very heavily,
    and nearly all the officers and men were prostrated
    with sea-sickness, and, moreover, had not yet found
    their sea-legs. As far as the crew was concerned,
    like all merchant ships, she only carried just enough
    men to do the necessary duties connected with the
    ship, and had certainly none to spare to look after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> the cargo, so it fell to the lot of two or three of the
    officers of the regiment, and perhaps half-a-dozen non-commissioned
    officers, who had managed to overcome
    their sea-sickness, and myself (because I had nothing
    else to do), to look after the horses. A great many
    had been cast in their stalls, owing to the very amateur
    fashion in which they had been tied up, and it was
    no light job to get the poor struggling animals on to
    their legs again and secure them properly with the
    ship rolling heavily. It was an all-night business;
    those few soldiers worked like heroes, and I, though
    I knew little about horses, could make myself useful,
    for a sailor does know how to tie a knot. It was
    therefore to the credit of all concerned that we never
    lost a horse at the time, though later on a few succumbed
    to violent pneumonia, brought on, I suppose,
    by the sudden change from severe cold to the appalling
    heat of the horse deck.</p>
<p>Two of the officers who did such good work all
    through that night I still occasionally meet. One
    was Captain Wenjy Jones, a fine horseman and a well-known
    owner of race-horses, and the other, then
    Lieutenant Sinclair, having retired from the Army
    and adopted a political career, after commencing as
    Assistant Private Secretary to Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman,
    is now Lord Pentland. He has, in his
    time, occupied several important posts, and has lately
    returned to England after serving his country for
    seven years as Governor of Madras.</p>
<p>It was not until we had nearly reached Gibraltar
    that the gale abated, and we were able to settle down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> in comparative comfort and take stock of our surroundings.
    When the weather was fine enough our
    precious horses were walked up inclined platforms to
    the upper deck, where they could get some light and
    air, and where, moreover, the men had room to groom
    them. They certainly needed strapping, for, having
    left Ireland as hairy as polar bears, and been suddenly
    translated into a warm climate, they literally shed their
    coats in handfuls.</p>
<p>On arriving at Port Said, I was set one of the most
    disagreeable tasks that ever came my way. Owing
    to the ridiculous fuss that had been made about the
    embarkation at Kingstown, the War Office Authorities
    were seized with one of their occasional spasmodic fits
    of virtue, and suddenly found it necessary to hold an
    inquiry into the conduct of the two Lieutenant-Colonels
    of the regiment; one having been left behind with
    one wing, while the other was commanding the
    portion ordered on active service. I received a telegram
    from the Admiralty ordering me to land the
    Lieutenant-Colonel in command, so I found myself in
    the position of having to go to a man who was old
    enough to be my father, much my superior in rank,
    and who had actually served in the Crimea, and tell
    him that he was to leave the ship. Whatever may
    have been his merits or demerits, it always seemed
    to me that he was treated with the grossest discourtesy
    by the Authorities, in his position of an officer commanding
    the wing of a regiment ordered on active
    service, and on the eve of taking the Field. Naturally,
    I had to obey orders, and landed he was, but I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> always wondered whether he was not wrong to take
    such an order from a junior officer belonging to
    another service, and whether he would not have
    been wiser to ignore such an irregular communication
    altogether, and to have gone to Souakim with the
    troops under his orders.</p>
<p>A few days afterwards the <i>Lydian Monarch</i> arrived
    at Souakim and the regiment disembarked, and a very
    fine show they made. The officers and men were,
    of course, delighted to be quit of the ship, and to be
    on active service, and the horses, thanks to the fact
    that we had been able to move them about, were in
    wonderful condition, considering that they had been
    cooped up on board for the major part of three
    weeks.</p>
<p>Having now arrived safely at Souakim and delivered
    the goods entrusted to my charge in the shape of the
    regiment, it may be convenient to say something of
    that almost forgotten campaign, the Souakim Expedition
    of 1885. The more it is considered in the cold
    light of history, or from what remains in the memory
    of a spectator and humble participant, the more absolutely
    am I convinced that, to use a modern expression,
    the whole Expedition was designed to be nothing but
    political &ldquo;eye-wash.&rdquo; The fact is the public were
    extremely indignant at the fall of Khartoum and the
    death of Gordon. Their indignation was considerably,
    if illogically, accentuated by the harmless fact that
    the Prime Minister, Mr. Gladstone, had gone to the
    theatre the very night the news of Gordon&rsquo;s death was
    received. Lord Salisbury, in the course of a debate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> on the announcement that the Government had decided
    to break the power of the Mahdi, had stated,
    what certainly looked to be the whole truth and
    nothing but the truth,&mdash;namely, &ldquo;that Gordon had
    been sacrificed to the squabbles of a Cabinet and the
    necessities of Party Politics.&rdquo; And what probably
    decided the dispatch of the Expedition, more than
    anything else, was the fact that a few days afterwards
    the Government only escaped defeat on a vote of
    censure on the Soudan policy, moved by Sir Stafford
    Northcote, by the narrow margin of fourteen votes.
    Altogether, things were not going at all happily for
    the Government, and so &ldquo;eye-wash&rdquo; of some kind
    was absolutely necessary, and I believe that those of
    us who were left till the last, save for the troops that
    remained to garrison the town of Souakim, one and
    all realised that nothing had ever been intended, and
    that all our labour and hardship had been only to keep
    a tottering Government in power for a little while
    longer. It is easy to show that nothing was intended,
    for exactly twelve months before, in March 1884, the
    hot weather had compelled the withdrawal of the
    troops from Souakim, although the route to Berber
    was then open; yet the Authorities were commencing
    an Expedition and sending <i>troops from England</i> at
    exactly the same time of the year at which they had
    brought a half-finished campaign to a close, <i>with troops
    on the spot</i>, only one year before! Of course, if, in
    the course of the fighting that would be sure to take
    place round about Souakim, Osman Digna&rsquo;s men could
    be badly beaten and Osman himself captured, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> they might reasonably assume that the Expedition had
    not been in vain, but it was pretty well known that
    Osman was an extremely elusive person, and anything
    but a likely captive. But enough has been said of the
    political emergencies of the moment and the sordid
    details connected with them. A British Army just
    taking the Field forms a far purer and more attractive
    spectacle.</p>
<p>As soon as the various transport officers arrived
    with the troops that had been put under their charge,
    they were employed entirely in duties connected with
    the port. We were about eight all told, under the
    orders of Captain Fellowes, Principal Naval Transport
    Officer, Commodore More Molyneux being the Senior
    Naval Officer who was in command of a squadron of
    small ships mainly drawn from the East Indian Station.
    We slept and messed on board a British India boat
    that had brought troops from India and had been
    reserved for the purpose, but except for a certain
    amount of sleep and extremely regular meals, we were
    never on board her. Captain Fellowes, and his Second
    in Command, Commander Morrison, who had commanded
    the <i>Helicon</i> at Alexandria and had been
    promoted, directed our labours. Two of the lieutenants
    did the work of harbour masters and brought
    the transports in and out of the coral reefs that formed
    the passage into the little harbour of Souakim.
    Their work was never-ending, from the time the sun
    was well up until shortly before nightfall. Even
    they, with all their skill and experience, could not
    take ships in and out when the sun was low, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> conning of the ships had to be done entirely by eye,
    and when a low sun was glimmering on the water
    it became impossible to see the edges of the reef;
    and on the rare occasions when, owing to the great
    pressure of work, it was necessary to go on when
    the sun was setting, we were almost invariably faced
    with a ship ashore on the reef, and a long day&rsquo;s work
    with tugs would ensue, to grind her off.</p>
<p>The rest of us were in charge of gangs of natives
    who did the work of unloading stores and of landing
    all sorts of transport animals, from camels to the little
    Indian bullocks that had been sent for the Indian
    transport. We toiled from sunrise to sunset under
    a blazing sun, and it was certainly a strenuous life.
    Nevertheless, I personally enjoyed my time immensely
    up to the moment when it began to dawn upon me
    that the whole Expedition was an imposture, and that
    the more stuff we landed the more we should have to
    re-embark again. The gang of which I usually had
    charge consisted of Egyptian prisoners, who were
    daily marched down to their work by an armed party
    of Turkish soldiers. I used to love the procedure
    of the armed guard. Being practical men and also
    remarkably lazy ones, the men of the guard invariably
    made the prisoners carry their rifles!</p>
<p>Shortly after our arrival I succeeded in annexing
    a stray pony which I found wandering about the
    beach, apparently belonging to no one in particular.
    At the same time I secured the services of a
    beach-comber in the shape of a retired soldier, also
    found on the beach, and him I made my groom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> There was any amount of forage littered about, so
    with a pony tethered to my tent and a man to look
    after him, I could always, when there was a spare
    moment, ride out to the lines and see what was
    going on.</p>
<p>On the 20th March, a very few days after we arrived
    at Souakim, General Sir Gerald Graham, who was
    Commander-in-Chief, ordered a reconnaissance on
    Hashin to be made in force, Hashin being a collection
    of huts about seven and a half miles from Souakim.
    I managed to get a day&rsquo;s leave and rode out with my
    friends of the 5th Lancers, but as my pony was not
    capable of keeping up with the big English horses of
    the Lancers, I left them after a short time and attached
    myself to the Guards&rsquo; Brigade, amongst whose officers
    I had various friends. Inside the Guards&rsquo; square I
    found General Lord Abinger, who had commanded a
    battalion of the Scots Fusilier Guards in the Crimea; he
    had contrived to come out to Souakim, and had ridden
    out to be with his old regiment. Another friend of
    mine in that square, as a spectator, was Lieutenant
    Alfred Paget, who was serving on board a gun-vessel
    in the harbour. He, like myself, had got a day&rsquo;s leave
    to go out and see the fun, and had attached himself to
    the Scots Guards, in which regiment his brother, now
    General Sir Arthur Paget, was serving. At one time
    it looked as if there was going to be a real action,
    for some 150 Soudanese, with the greatest gallantry,
    charged the Guards&rsquo; Brigade. Naturally, the fire with
    which they were received was more than they could
    stand, and those who were not shot down bolted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> fled. It seemed to the spectator that the action was
    somewhat futile, for though some zeriba posts were
    established, the works were dismantled again, the place
    was abandoned a few days afterwards, and, as far as
    the day was concerned, the force having marched some
    seven miles out were marched back again, and we
    reached our base about six in the evening.</p>
<p>There were a certain number of casualties from
    what I judged to be long-range rifle fire, and, packed
    as the square was with transport, it presented a
    wonderful target even to very inferior marksmen.
    As Lord Abinger remarked at the time: &ldquo;he had
    often heard of men shooting so badly that they
    could not hit a haystack, but nobody could miss a
    farm-yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two days afterwards the action known as McNeill&rsquo;s
    Zareba was fought. I was not able to see anything
    of it. At the time it became a source of much controversy,
    but anyhow it was not altogether without
    results. For though we lost an enormous number of
    transport animals, 900 camels alone being killed, the
    Soudanese lost very heavily, over 1000 bodies being
    left on the field.</p>
<p>We laboured on throughout the rest of the months
    of March and April, landing stores, now supplemented
    by the necessary materials for the much-discussed
    Souakim to Berber Railway. Some advance was made
    with that railway; at one time it reached as far as
    Otao, eighteen miles from the base, but when, early
    in May, Lord Wolseley arrived on the scene, it
    became apparent to us all that the end was approaching.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> Gradually the navvies were withdrawn and sent back
    to England; many store ships, with railway material
    that, mercifully, had not been unloaded, were sent
    home. The Commander-in-Chief left on the 17th of
    May, and by the end of that month all the troops,
    with the exception of the Berkshire Regiment and
    a few Indian troops, who were left behind to garrison
    Souakim, had departed.</p>
<p>Captain Royle, in his book on the Egyptian Campaigns
    1882 to 1899, mentions in a footnote that
    Osman wrote to the Madhi that &ldquo;God struck fear
    into the hearts of the English and they went away.&rdquo;
    And small wonder if Osman was able to boast in
    1885, as he had previously done in 1884, that he
    had driven the British out of the country.</p>
<p>Captain Royle in another footnote gives the extra
    cost of the expedition as over two millions, and the
    cost of the Souakim-Berber Railway (including pipe
    and water lines), which, as mentioned before, was
    actually laid for eighteen miles, as over £865,000.
    This cost was incurred over and above the normal
    charge for the maintenance of the troops concerned.
    In the interests of economy it is pleasant to know
    that a small portion of the eighteen miles of line was
    picked up and re-shipped, to be used afterwards for
    some years as a light railway at Shorncliffe Camp, to
    take the men down to the sea to bathe.</p>
<p>Early in June the work of the Naval Transport
    came to an end. I remember well the last evening
    I spent there. I walked round the scene of our four
    months&rsquo; hard labour with my chief, Captain Fellowes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> and thought that never had the forage which had
    fallen into the water, and the general debris on the
    beach, smelt more abominably. It was not for nothing
    that my sense of smell was so acute, for next morning
    I was down with fever. It was bad luck to be knocked
    out just as the work was finished, but so it was, and
    the climate of the Red Sea in the month of June is
    not the best in the world for a speedy recovery.
    However, I was packed up in a horrible little transport
    that was bound for Suez, and after a very long
    passage managed to reach Cairo. There was an old
    Indian doctor on board in charge of the odds and
    ends of troops and invalids, who had served all his
    life in India, and thoroughly understood the treatment
    of fever. His method, if drastic, was certainly efficient.
    Every two hours he used to appear with a huge
    tumbler of champagne and quinine and insist on its
    being swallowed. For the whole week that I was on
    board I was more or less insensible from the strength
    of this mixture, but after a couple of days in Cairo
    in a decent bed I was quite well again, though much
    pulled down, and was able to proceed home overland
    by way of Venice.</p>
<p>Barring the natural resentment we all felt at having
    laboured for months in the sun in unloading stores
    for an Expedition that was never intended to succeed,
    I personally have otherwise nothing but pleasant recollections
    of Souakim. Some of the finest men in the
    world were out there. I found many old friends, and
    made some new ones, one of whom remained a great
    ally of mine until his death two years ago. I refer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> to Lieutenant Alfred Paget, who died as Admiral Sir
    Alfred Paget. He also deserved the title of the
    bravest of the brave. When not on duty at Souakim
    he used  to amuse himself by going into the dense
    bush outside our lines for the purpose of shooting
    sand grouse and gazelle. The bush was supposed to
    be crawling with Soudanese, but the old proverb of
    &ldquo;where there is no fear there is no danger&rdquo; held good
    in his case, and he was never interfered with. Years
    afterwards he was Naval Attaché at Washington during
    the American-Spanish War, and of course managed to
    see as much fighting as was possible. When the war
    came to an end, at a big dinner at which he was one
    of the guests, after the usual patriotic toasts had been
    honoured, the General Officer presiding at the dinner
    asked all present to charge their glasses to drink the
    health of the bravest man they had met during the
    campaign. No one had any idea whose name was to
    be coupled with this toast. The name was that of
    Captain Alfred Paget, Royal Navy, Naval Attaché at
    Washington. Surely one of the most graceful compliments
    that ever was paid to a British officer! and
    none who knew him could doubt how thoroughly it
    had been deserved. In the recent war he sank his
    rank of Admiral, and (until bad health compelled him
    to give up), served as a Commander of various patrol
    vessels and mine-sweepers. He died very suddenly
    at the age of sixty-seven.</p>
<p>Shortly after arriving in England I looked in at
    87, St. James&rsquo;s Street, to see my old friends. Thinking
    to enlist their compassion I informed them that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> owing to hard work and fever, I had lost twenty
    pounds, upon which I was told that twenty pounds
    could be easily lost in less than an hour there, and
    that, very rightly, was the only sign of sympathy that
    I could extract from them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER  VI</a></h2>
<h3>THE CHANNEL FLEET AND MEDITERRANEAN STATION</h3>
<p>After a short leave I was appointed to the <i>Minotaur</i>,
    the Flagship of the Channel Squadron, and found
    myself once more as a watch-keeping lieutenant at sea,
    very pleased at having successfully eluded an examination
    in high mathematics at Greenwich.</p>
<p>My time in the <i>Minotaur</i> was one of the happiest
    of the whole of my service afloat. She flew the flag
    of Vice-Admiral Charles Fellowes, one of the most
    popular admirals in the Navy. My Souakim employer,
    John Fellowes, was Flag-Captain, and amongst the
    lieutenants were my old friend, Jimmy Startin, previously
    alluded to, and an old Red Sea comrade, Oliver
    Young by name. Oliver was a great character. Very
    good-looking, standing well over six feet, and of
    gigantic strength, he was passionately fond of fighting
    whenever a decent opportunity occurred; but at the
    same time he was no bully, and never exercised his
    great skill and strength except in a good cause. There
    were many amusing stories about him, and one of the
    best was the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>At one period of his career he was appointed as
    Junior Lieutenant to a gunboat in the Mediterranean,
    whose First-Lieutenant had the reputation of being the
    most disagreeable Commanding Officer in the Service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> and one who always made life as unpleasant as possible
    to the unfortunate beings who were compelled to serve
    under his orders. Oliver, when he joined, was perfectly
    aware of this fact. On joining the gunboat,
    when pacing the deck with his new Commanding
    Officer, who, of course, had not yet had time to show
    the cloven hoof, Oliver began to expatiate on the joys
    of serving on a small craft, to his mind the only life
    in the Navy that was really agreeable. He went on to
    say that as long as everybody lived in harmony no life
    could be pleasanter. He mentioned that he had been
    received in the most charming way by his new messmates,
    and felt certain that he was going to be extremely
    happy in his new post. Then he pensively added:
    &ldquo;Of course, it is only one&rsquo;s own fault if anybody on
    board makes himself disagreeable; nothing is easier,
    on a dark night, than to catch hold of the delinquent
    and just drop him overboard, and that settles the
    matter.&rdquo; The First-Lieutenant said nothing, but being
    a little man, hardly reaching up to Oliver&rsquo;s shoulder,
    he thought a great deal, and for the rest of the commission
    treated his big subordinate with the greatest
    consideration.</p>
<p>Not long after the <i>Minotaur</i> days, Oliver left the
    Service and went into Parliament. But he never really
    recovered from a bad sunstroke that laid him low at
    Souakim, and, to the great regret of his many friends,
    both ashore and afloat, he died at a comparatively early
    age. Another old <i>Minotaur</i> friend was Sir Charles
    Cust, then a midshipman, now Naval Equerry to His
    Majesty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<p>We were extremely well off for lieutenants in the
    flagship, so the watch-keeping was far less onerous
    than in the <i>Superb</i>, the result being, that leave ashore
    was much easier to obtain. Nearly the whole winter
    was spent up the Tagus, and of Lisbon and its surroundings
    I have the most pleasant recollections. We
    had a wonderful Opera Season, with those incomparable
    artists, Mesdames Patti and Scalchi as prima donna
    and contralto, the primo tenore being the great
    Massini, one of the finest tenors of his days. We
    arranged a very comfortable omnibus box at the Opera
    for ourselves, and as an enterprising native had started
    an establishment where roulette was nightly played for
    the special benefit(?) of the officers of the Fleet, and as
    there was pigeon-shooting at the Sporting Club every
    Sunday, we certainly had plenty of distractions. It was
    at the Sporting Club there, that I first had the honour
    of making the acquaintance of King Carlos, who was so
    foully murdered years afterwards in the streets of his
    capital. He was a fine pigeon shot, and I was destined
    later on to see him shooting in Norfolk, where his
    skill with the gun became quite a topic of conversation.</p>
<p>But perhaps the happiest recollections of all were of
    the frequent visits we used to pay to Cintra, where we
    were treated by the English hotel-keeper and his family
    with the greatest kindness, and, moreover, on what
    can only be described as the &ldquo;most favoured nation&rdquo;
    terms. Among the many beautiful gardens in which
    we were allowed to stroll about was that belonging to
    the Villa of Monserrate, which had originally belonged
    to Beckford, the author of <i>Vathek</i>. It had been sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>sequently
    acquired by the family of the present Sir
    Frederick Cook. The present baronet, I believe, still
    retains the title of Vicomte de Monserrate. I remember
    the guide always used to explain: &ldquo;Dis
    de villa of Vicomte de Monserrate, Mr. Cookey
    English!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there is no need for me to write at length on
    the beauties of Cintra. Many have written about it;
    many more have seen that lovely mountain of verdure
    that springs from what is apparently an absolutely arid
    plain. To me it simply remains as one of the most
    beautiful places I have ever seen, and one where I
    spent many happy days.</p>
<p>But life on board the <i>Minotaur</i> was very far from
    consisting entirely of amusement. Although we continued
    to use Lisbon as our headquarters, the Squadron
    constantly went to sea for short cruises and firing-practice.
    Moreover, sail-drill went on with almost the
    same regularity as when I joined the Service. The <i>Minotaur</i> had three full-rigged masts, to say nothing
    of two light masts further aft, and I, to my great
    delight, was in charge of one of the three. She also
    possessed a very fine clear upper deck, so, when not
    competing with other ships of the squadron, we could
    compete one mast against the other, to our great satisfaction.
    My mind still dwells with pleasure on the days of
    the old sailing frigates, and even on those of the rigged
    iron-clads that succeeded them. The <i>Minotaur</i> was to
    end sail-drill so far as I was concerned, as, after leaving
    her, I never served in a rigged ship again.</p>
<p>After a very pleasant winter, we started on a cruise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> the first port of call being Gibraltar. Our Admiral had
    latterly been far from well, and on the way to Gibraltar
    was taken seriously ill. Shortly after we arrived
    at Gibraltar there was a sudden collapse, and he died,
    deeply to the regret of the officers and men of his
    squadron. The <i>Minotaur</i> was lying alongside the
    Mole, and for the first time since the <i>Victory</i> lay there
    with the mortal remains of Nelson on board, an
    admiral&rsquo;s flag was to be seen flying half-masted in that
    historic bay. His funeral having been ordered to take
    place in England, the <i>Minotaur</i> proceeded to Portsmouth
    with the utmost dispatch. The funeral of a
    Flag-Officer, dying on service, is an impressive affair, as
    becomes the rank of the deceased and the extreme
    rarity of the occasion, there is something moving in
    the spectacle of the hoisting out of the coffin, while
    the flag flutters slowly down, not to be hoisted again
    until a successor comes on board to take over the
    command.</p>
<p>Our new Admiral turned out to be Sir William
    Hewett, V.C., a very distinguished officer, who had
    won his Victoria Cross as a mate in the Crimea. He
    had been lately commanding the naval forces on the
    East Indian Station, and during the first Egyptian
    campaign had been responsible for the occupation of
    Suez and the operations that were terminated by the
    middle of August 1882 to complete our occupation of
    the Canal. In February 1884, after Baker&rsquo;s defeat at
    El Teb, he had landed a Naval Brigade at Souakim for
    the protection of the town, and had accompanied Sir
    Gerald  Graham  when he fought a successful action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> there, a fortnight later. Greatly to our satisfaction,
    Captain Fellowes remained on with him as Flag-Captain.</p>
<p>In the days of which I am writing the ignorance of
    the British public of everything regarding the Navy
    can only be described as colossal. Of course at great
    naval ports, such as Chatham, Portsmouth and Plymouth,
    the Navy was well known, but outside those
    three areas lived a huge public who had never seen a
    man-of-war, and hardly ever seen a sailor unless he
    happened to be on leave, and in plain clothes. The
    public took not the slightest interest in anything that
    concerned that Force, which (in the words of the special
    prayer that is read daily on the quarter-deck of every
    ship in the Service) enables the British public&mdash;in other
    words &ldquo;the inhabitants of our Island&rdquo;&mdash;to live in such
    security that they &ldquo;may in peace and quietness serve
    Thee our God.&rdquo; I am completely unaware if it is
    generally known that the insertion of this Prayer
    amongst other forms of prayer to be used at sea, in our
    Liturgy, was due to the action of the Long Parliament.
    The gorgeous language and rhetorical style of the whole
    Prayer is worthy of those great days, when England
    was so mighty abroad. Oliver Cromwell, one of the
    finest soldiers of the world, was keenly alive to the
    importance of Sea Power, and always maintained a
    strong Navy.</p>
<p>I suppose the Admiralty thought it was nearly time
    that the public should see something of one of the
    Forces for which they paid taxes, and consequently
    the Channel Squadron was ordered to cruise round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> coasts of England and Scotland, besides which it was
    conveyed to those in command that every facility was
    to be given to enable sight-seers to visit the various
    ships of the Fleet to their hearts&rsquo; content. At some
    ports, Glasgow in particular, the tourists came literally
    in thousands, and of course converted the ships into
    temporary pigsties and bear gardens; but any trifling
    inconvenience of that sort was more than amply repaid
    by the universal kindness and hospitality that we received
    everywhere. The officers were invited to shoot over
    moors, of which, up to that time, they had only
    dreamt, and the men were lavishly entertained by all
    sorts of municipal authorities, and kind people in the
    neighbourhood.</p>
<p>I personally, was in luck&rsquo;s way, as the shooting part
    of the business was generally put into the hands of the
    Flag-Captain, and, being an old friend, perhaps I got
    rather more than my fair share. Anyhow, I can remember
    a first-rate grouse drive over one of Sir Michael
    Shaw Stewart&rsquo;s best beats at Ardnagowan, and, later on,
    when the Fleet lay at Cromarty Firth, a party of us
    stayed with Ross of Cromarty, at Cromarty House, and
    had a capital day&rsquo;s mixed shooting. The Fleet was
    also magnificently entertained at a ball during our stay
    in the Firth, the great magnates of the district, including
    the then Duke of Sutherland, the grandfather of the
    present Duke, figuring amongst the hosts. Later on,
    whilst lying in the Firth of Forth, a party of us went
    to Selkirk, staying a night at the hotel there, for the
    purpose of shooting over one of the low-lying moors
    that the Duke of Buccleugh had placed at our disposal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> Without exception it was the best mixed day&rsquo;s shooting
    in which I have ever taken part. It was early in October,
    and towards the end of the day we were just off the
    moor itself, beating a small cover for pheasants, and then
    I saw a sight which personally I have never seen since.
    The beaters had included in their drive not only the
    cover before mentioned but also a large stubble field.
    Being late in the evening, the black game and grouse
    from the moors had got down to the stubble to feed on
    the stooks. The result was that, driven to the guns,
    and all in the air at the same time, were to be seen black
    game, pheasants, grouse and partridges.</p>
<p>A little later on we were anchored off the Norfolk
    coast, and the last shoot of the trip was from Yarmouth,
    where that splendid old sportsman, Mr. Fellowes of
    Shotesham, provided the sport. The Flag-Captain was
    a relative of Mr. Fellowes, and once more I was fortunate
    enough to be of the party. We were given a fine day&rsquo;s
    partridge-driving by the Squire of Shotesham, and
    personally I am glad to have known, if only for a few
    hours, a man who, in his day, was not only one of the
    best shots in the kingdom, but who also had the reputation
    of being able to ride a half-broken three-year-old
    that was in the process of learning its future business as
    a hunter, better than any one else in this country.</p>
<p>The visit to Yarmouth having terminated, the
    squadron was presently back at Portsmouth again, and
    during the winter certain changes were made among
    the officers, notably in the case of the Captain. It had
    been arranged that Captain Fellowes was to go out to
    the Mediterranean as Flag-Captain to Admiral H.R.H.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> the Duke of Edinburgh, who had been selected for the
    important post of Commander-in-Chief of that Station.
    So, at the end of 1885, he left, much to our regret,
    and was succeeded by Captain Bouverie-Clark. On
    board the <i>Minotaur</i> we soon found out that, sorry as
    we might be to lose our old Captain, we had really lost
    nothing by the exchange, for his successor was one of
    the most charming men I ever served with.</p>
<p>Vice-Admiral Sir Bouverie-Clark, as he now is, had
    managed to see as much active service as had been
    possible in the days of his youth, for, as a midshipman,
    he had been present at the bombardment of Sveaborg
    in the Baltic during the Crimean war, had later on
    greatly distinguished himself by his gallantry when
    employed on the East Coast of Africa in the suppression
    of the Slave Trade, and was also an officer in the
    Naval Brigade that was landed during the New Zealand
    War in the early &rsquo;sixties. He was finally Director of
    Transports at the Admiralty for a period of five years,
    from 1906 onwards.</p>
<p>The remaining six months which I spent in the <i>Minotaur</i> were uneventful, but another change was
    about to be made, as in July 1886 I was appointed as
    First-Lieutenant to H.M. Dispatch Vessel <i>Surprise</i>,
    then a brand-new ship.</p>

<p>The <i>Surprise</i> and her sister ship, the <i>Alacrity</i> were
    built to replace respectively the old dispatch boats <i>Helicon</i> and <i>Vigilant</i>, which had been serving for years
    on the Mediterranean and China Stations. Commander
    Charles le Strange, a very old friend of the <i>Sultan</i> days,
    was in command of the <i>Surprise</i>. He had recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> become an Equerry to H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh,
    who had already taken over the command of the
    Mediterranean Station.</p>
<p>The <i>Surprise</i> was a fairly useful vessel in many
    respects and could have been made much better had
    not the Admiralty thought fit to arm her with four
    or five 4½-inch guns, which she really was unfit to
    carry; the weight might well have been utilised
    in other directions. The accommodation aft for distinguished
    passengers was very good, and when in
    harbour, as far as they were concerned, she was a very
    nice yacht; but at sea, when steaming at any speed, the
    vibration was so terrific, that very few of them could
    stand being aft, and they generally used to come on the
    bridge and camp out there, which was not always very
    convenient to the officers who were carrying out their
    duties. However, the sea trips were generally short,
    and on the whole she answered very well, and only
    disappeared from service a few years ago. Having
    commissioned her, I was of course on board during her
    steam trials. With picked coal, and, moreover, with
    (what is more important still) picked stokers, she succeeded
    in going about eighteen knots on the measured
    mile, and under the same favourable circumstances did
    quite well on her six hours&rsquo; full-speed trial, averaging
    nearly sixteen knots. But we were to be bitterly
    disappointed in her performances later on. Without
    adventitious aids she turned out to be a very moderate
    steamer and not the best of sea boats. The first
    distinguished passenger we were ordered to embark
    was the Duke of Connaught. His Royal Highness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> was about to start for India, and wishing to curtail the
    length of his journey, decided to travel to Marseilles
    overland, from thence to be conveyed to Malta in the <i>Surprise</i>, where he could hit off the P. &amp; O. steamer
    which was to take him to his destination. It became a
    question of accurate timing, as the P. &amp; O. boats were
    in the habit of staying but very few hours at Malta.
    Consequently, the question arose of the number of
    hours it would take the <i>Surprise</i> to go from Marseilles
    to Malta. The Captain and I put our heads together,
    and though we were much too old hands at the game
    to place very implicit reliance in full-speed trials as
    conducted by the Admiralty, we thought we could safely
    guarantee an average speed of thirteen knots, which
    seemed to leave a very fair margin up our sleeves.
    About the end of August we left the port of
    Marseilles with our Royal passenger on board, steaming
    gaily some fourteen and a half knots. The heat was
    very great, and the stokers, though very willing, were
    mostly young hands, the coal was very far from being
    picked, so the speed of the ship, in spite of every effort,
    gradually got lower and lower, and we finally crawled
    into Malta at the ignoble speed of about ten knots, a
    good many hours late. It was a very mortifying
    début to make on our station, and it was a long time
    before we heard the last of it.</p>
<p>People interested in the Navy, who read the official
    accounts of the trials of new ships that always used to
    be published in <i>The Times</i>, may gather from this
    sad experience what a difference there is in actual
    practice between the performances that are published,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> and what is apt to be realised later on under normal
    conditions. (Eye-wash again!)</p>
<p>From 1886 to 1888, during my term of service
    on board the <i>Surprise</i>, the Mediterranean Station was
    at its zenith as regards strength and importance. It
    had been looked upon for many years as the Blue
    Ribbon of the Navy, and as regards the person of the
    Commander-in-Chief, it naturally gained additional
    éclat from the fact that no less a personage than H.R.H.
    Vice-Admiral the Duke of Edinburgh, the second
    son of Queen Victoria, was Commander-in-Chief, with
    the local rank of Admiral. His Royal Highness had
    hoisted his flag in February 1886 in the <i>Alexandra</i>,
    and in addition to her had seven of the most modern
    of our armour-clad ships under his command, with
    a considerable number of small craft, principally
    employed on service in the Red Sea. The Admiral
    and many of his Captains have joined the majority, but
    amongst others who are still with us, are the present
    Admiral Sir Compton Domville, then Captain of
    the <i>Temeraire</i>, and subsequently Commander-in-Chief
    of the Mediterranean Station; Admiral Sir Henry
    Stephenson,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> now Usher of the Black Rod, then commanding
    the <i>Dreadnought</i>, had under his orders our
    present King, serving as a Lieutenant on board that
    ship; Admiral of the Fleet Sir Hedworth Meux, then
    Commander Lambton, in command of the <i>Dolphin</i> sloop; another Admiral, now the Marquis of Milford
    Haven, was, as Prince Louis of Battenberg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> Commander of the <i>Dreadnought</i>; while prominent
    among the Lieutenants serving in the different ships
    were the late Admirals Sir George Warrender, and Sir
    Frederick Hamilton, and the late Captain the Hon.
    Hugh Tyrrwhitt. Admirals Sir Cecil Colville, Sir
    Colin Keppel and Sir James Startin, all of whose
    names have already occurred in these notes, Midshipman
    David Beatty of the <i>Alexandra</i>, now Admiral of the
    Fleet Earl Beatty, are still, I am rejoiced to think, very
    much alive.</p>
<p>Malta, where I was to spend a great deal of my life
    for the next two years, was very gay. The Duchess
    of Edinburgh passed the whole of the winter there.
    The Governor had temporarily made over the palace
    of San Antonio, with its wonderful orange gardens, to
    the Duke and Duchess during their stay at Malta, so
    it was there that I first had the honour of making
    the acquaintance of Her Imperial Highness and her
    children. Her two eldest daughters were then only
    about eleven and twelve years of age, but already gave
    promise of great beauty; indeed, the eldest, the
    present Queen of Roumania, was, and still is, one of
    the most beautiful and attractive women in the world.
    The Duchess herself, if I may take the liberty of
    saying so, was, and is, a very remarkable woman.
    For the only daughter of the Emperor Alexander (in
    those days the greatest potentate in the world), it was
    in some ways rather a step downwards to marry a
    second son, even though he was the son of Queen
    Victoria; and, moreover, to be in a certain sense merely
    the wife of an Admiral when the Duke was employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> on the duties of his profession; but she certainly
    succeeded, in her position as wife to the Commander-in-Chief,
    in making herself extremely popular with the
    Naval Officers at Malta. The dinners at San Antonio
    were infinitely more agreeable and less stiff than the
    sort of entertainments which were generally given at
    the various Admiralty Houses that I have known, and
    a command to dine there was not only an honour but
    a very distinct pleasure into the bargain.</p>
<p>Her Imperial Highness, like most of her compatriots,
    adored the South. She was devoted to Italian
    art, and lost no opportunity of seeing everything that
    was worth seeing in Italy and Sicily, and were I to
    catalogue all the interesting places that the <i>Surprise</i> visited in the course of two years, sometimes in
    company with the rest of the Fleet, and sometimes
    on detached cruises &ldquo;on her own,&rdquo; the result would be
    like nothing in the world so much as a portion of
    &ldquo;Baedeker&rdquo; on Italy.</p>
<p>But before saying anything more about trips, the
    main interest of which consisted in seeing some of
    the wonders of Italy, I must write of two or three
    cruises that were nothing if not official.</p>
<p>The first important duty which devolved on the <i>Surprise</i>, very shortly after her arrival on the station,
    was to convey the Admiral, in his dual capacity as
    a son of Queen Victoria and also as Commander-in-Chief
    of the Mediterranean, to pay an official visit to
    the Sultan. This visit was a very interesting one, and
    though I do not pretend to any inside knowledge of
    the motives which inspired it, or made its recurrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> necessary, the following year, I have a shrewd suspicion
    that what was evident to any spectator, was not very
    far remote from the truth. The late Sir Edward
    Thornton, who was then our Ambassador to the
    Sublime Port, had served his country with great
    distinction and held many important posts. He had
    been Ambassador both at Washington and Petersburg,
    but none the less it is possible that, being a remarkably
    straightforward English gentleman, that hotbed of
    intrigue and lies, the Turkish Capital, was not exactly
    the place for him. At any rate, it was noticeable, even
    to an outsider like myself, that the Duke&rsquo;s reception
    was distinctly of a cold nature. The last function of
    the visit consisted in a dinner at the Yildiz Kiosque,
    at which the Duke was the guest of the evening, most
    of his officers, I being one of the number, being
    included in the dinner party. There was considerable
    delay when the Englishmen arrived at the palace, and
    finally the Sultan sent a message to say that he was
    unwell and unable to be present. There was nothing
    for it but to dine, and it certainly seemed to me as
    if the honours of the house were done by Monsieur
    Nelidoff, the Russian Ambassador, who was known
    to be all-powerful at that moment, and having been
    there for a good many years, was the natural doyen
    of the Corps Diplomatique. Apparently, the Government
    at home were distinctly dissatisfied with the
    reception that had been accorded to an English Prince,
    who was also holding a very high official position, and
    the upshot of it was that Sir Edward Thornton was
    withdrawn and Sir William White, to whom allusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> has already been made, was appointed in his place.
    The Duke, to make the outgoing Ambassador&rsquo;s
    departure more dignified, placed the <i>Surprise</i> at his
    disposal, so, later in the year, towards the end of
    October, we found ourselves in Turkish waters again.
    The Ambassador was still at his summer residence at
    Therapia, and embarked from there with Lady Thornton
    and his daughters. His departure was certainly impressive
    enough, for all the &ldquo;<i>chers collègues</i>&rdquo; came in
    their state caïques to see him off, and the multitude
    of floral offerings reminded me of nothing so much
    as a very expensive funeral. Anyhow, one is glad to
    think that a very distinguished public servant, under
    such circumstances, had at any rate a more fitting
    conveyance than an ordinary mail steamer, though I
    am not sure that for the long passage, as it was to
    Marseilles, a mail steamer might not have been a more
    comfortable ship in which to travel.</p>
<p>Next year the <i>Surprise</i> again conveyed the Duke
    to Constantinople on a similar mission, and this time
    there was no mistake about the way in which he was
    received. We had hardly anchored in the Golden
    Horn, and the usual official callers had barely arrived
    on board when a huge caïque, with one of the Sultan&rsquo;s
    Aides-de-Camp, came alongside laden up with every sort
    of thing&mdash;sheep, Turkish sweetmeats, countless cigarettes
    and cases of champagne&mdash;with a message to say
    that not only was the Duke the Sultan&rsquo;s honoured
    guest, but that His Majesty wished every officer and
    man serving on board the <i>Surprise</i> to consider himself
    as a guest as well. The Sultan was, on this occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> present at the dinner at Yildiz and all went
    well.</p>
<p>Sir William White had lived the greater part of his
    life in the Middle East and thoroughly understood
    how to handle the Turk. A diplomatist of that nation
    once told me the following story which I believe to
    be absolutely true. On one occasion, during Sir
    William&rsquo;s reign at Constantinople, the Grand Vizier
    had come to see him on some business, and the interview
    had not been a very peaceable one. The Grand
    Vizier was insisting rather peremptorily on his point
    when he was suddenly interrupted: &ldquo;Monsieur le
    Grand Vizier, je vous defends de me parler sur ce
    ton là&mdash;à la porte!&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;à la porte&rdquo; the Grand
    Vizier went, to return next day in a very chastened
    spirit to make his submission.</p>
<p>Some of the <i>Surprise&rsquo;s</i> cruises are worth mentioning.
    One of the earliest, with the Duchess on board, after
    commencing at Naples extended itself to Leghorn
    and Genoa, from the first of which ports Florence
    could easily be reached. At Naples in those days the
    Consul was Mr. Neville-Rolfe. He was intended by
    Nature to be a Norfolk Squire and to live at his place,
    Heacham Hall, but fate and falling rents decreed
    otherwise, so he took up his residence at Naples, where
    he was Consul for many years. Naturally a keen lover
    of art, he had in addition made a close study of the
    late Greek, and early Roman periods, and a more
    delightful guide to Naples it was impossible to meet.
    Under his auspices, the Duchess, and we of the ship
    who were privileged to accompany her, saw Naples in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> a most interesting way. Excavation work was going
    on (as indeed it nearly always is) at Pompei, and for
    the benefit of such a distinguished visitor a very
    promising portion of a Pompeian house was excavated.
    Talk about sport! Nothing is really more exciting
    than digging, and I can remember the breathless way
    we hung over the digger when his delicately handled
    trowel had obviously met with something worth exhuming.
    The something was generally a fragment
    of one of the inevitable amphoræ that are dug up
    literally by the dozen, (as indeed befits vessels that once
    contained wine,) and are so common as to be valueless.
    The result of the investigation that we witnessed was
    very disappointing, like many another day&rsquo;s sport.
    The only thing of the smallest interest that we discovered
    was an ivory make-up box that probably had
    belonged, some eighteen hundred years ago, to some
    Pompeian beauty. Baiæ was also visited. It was easy
    for the <i>Surprise</i> to run round and anchor in the bay
    there, and in fine weather there was no difficulty in
    landing passengers on the beach in the immediate
    vicinity of that splendid series of temples.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine a more agreeable place for a
    ship to winter in than was Malta at that time, especially
    in the <i>Surprise&rsquo;s</i> case when a long stay there could be
    broken by cruises to Sicily and the mainland of Italy.
    Polo was our principal amusement, and besides a
    number of keen naval players, among whom must be
    included our present King, then Prince George of Wales,
    there were the officers of two or three very sporting
    regiments, (the Gordon Highlanders in particular,) who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> took an active part in the game, the result being that
    we were all hard at it two or three times in the week.
    Fortunately for me, the <i>Surprise</i> being looked upon as
    a sort of tender to the flagship, I generally made one of
    the <i>Alexandra</i> team in ship against ship, and fleet against
    garrison, matches. I am afraid in those days I was
    heathen enough to prefer polo to art, and so, much as I
    liked the cruises, I have to confess that it was a pleasure
    to get back to Malta and my ponies again. The pony
    racing, too, was capital fun. Hedworth Lambton,
    who had then, and still retains, his family&rsquo;s love for
    the sport, had some good ponies, and many of the
    officers of the garrison went in for racing very seriously;
    any betting that was necessary, could be done on the
    Indian system of the selling lottery.</p>
<p>But in addition to ponies the Navy had a very
    valuable racing possession, which amounted almost to
    a monopoly, namely the best light-weight jockey in
    the island, in the person of Midshipman David Beatty,
    who, being of a riding family, had been well brought
    up by his father&mdash;the Major of that name. Major
    Beatty knew, and no man better, not only all about
    the animal, horse, but how he should be ridden, and
    his son had profited to the full by the lessons he had
    received as a small boy.</p>
<p>And so the winter slipped pleasantly away. The
    summer of 1887 was made memorable in England by
    the celebration of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s Jubilee. It was,
    of course, necessary for the Duke of Edinburgh to be
    present in England during the period of the festivities,
    so in June the <i>Surprise</i> conveyed him to Marseilles <i>en</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> <i>route</i> to London. The <i>Surprise</i> was directed to remain
    at Marseilles until his expected return in a week&rsquo;s time.
    Meanwhile, the Fleet was ordered to the Balearic
    Islands, where he could rejoin it and continue the
    summer cruise which had just begun. The port of
    La Joliette where we lay was somewhat malodorous
    and stuffy in the month of June, so, as soon as the
    Admiral had left the ship, the Captain and I decided
    to take a few days&rsquo; leave, he being bent on going to
    Paris, whilst I selected Monte Carlo. I duly returned
    the night before the <i>Surprise</i> was timed to sail, and,
    arriving on board heard, rather to my surprise, that
    the Captain had not yet appeared. However, as he
    had talked of going to Paris I came to the conclusion
    that he had arranged to meet the Duke there and
    would travel back with him. The <i>Surprise</i> was made
    ready for sea in the morning to move out the moment
    the Admiral was on board, and the officers were duly
    fallen in to meet him at the gangway, when it was
    noticed that the Captain was not in the boat. As he
    stepped on board the Admiral&rsquo;s first question was the
    very natural one: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the Captain?&rdquo; Of course
    no answer was forthcoming; the only things to do
    were to inform the Consul in case there had been any
    foul play, and to acquaint the Admiralty, both of which
    were done.</p>
<p>The <i>Surprise</i> at once proceeded on her way, and I
    received an acting-commission as Commander, pending
    the time when a new one could be appointed and join.
    Of course it was very pleasant to be in command, and
    I could only hope that the Admiralty would be a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> time considering who they could appoint to supersede
    me; but meanwhile we were all greatly distressed
    about our missing Captain. Personally, I was devoted
    to him. Clever and agreeable, with a strong artistic
    sense which he had inherited from his father, the
    Squire of Hunstanton, who had been himself no mean
    frescoist in his time, I am deeply indebted to him for
    giving me my first introduction to the great painters
    and sculptors of Italy, of whose work he had made an
    intimate study, and a more interesting and amusing
    cicerone never existed. It turned out that instead of
    going to Paris he had betaken himself to Avignon, to
    visit the numerous antiquities there. The weather
    was very hot, and a sunstroke had been followed by
    brain fever. Many days passed before his family succeeded
    in tracing him, and, though he recovered, and
    served again as Commander of an iron-clad in the
    Mediterranean, he was never quite the same man
    again. It was not many years later that I was one of
    the mourners at his graveside when he was buried in
    the churchyard that lay close to his beautiful old home
    in Norfolk.</p>
<p>The Admiral, having rejoined his Fleet and been
    transhipped to his flagship, continued the summer
    cruise; but the <i>Surprise</i> was ordered off to Cadiz to
    be placed at the disposal of our Ambassador to Spain,
    the late Sir Clare Ford. The King of Spain had
    decided to open a maritime exhibition which was to be
    held at Cadiz, and there being a tremendous run on
    all the hotel accommodation there, the Duke, with his
    usual kindness, lent his dispatch boat to the Am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>bassador
    to be used as a temporary residence. Accordingly,
    Sir Clare and his son, Mr. Johnny Ford, took
    up their abode on board for a few days, while the
    festivities were taking place. The rest of the personnel
    of the Embassy had, I believe, billeted themselves on
    the many hospitable Englishmen connected with the
    Xeres wine trade, who lived in the neighbourhood.
    Sir Clare and his son were both very agreeable guests,
    and I continued to see a good deal of Johnny (as he
    was always called) until the time of his death, a short
    time ago. He served for some years in the Diplomatic
    Service, but his health broke down completely, owing,
    I have always heard, to some mysterious ailment which
    he was unfortunate enough to contract whilst serving
    at our Legation in Persia. He was very clever, and
    a well-known figure in the more artistic side of London
    Society. Sir Clare, at Madrid, was very much the right
    man in the right place, for he knew the country well;
    his father had lived there many years, and was responsible
    for that delightful book, <i>Wanderings in Spain</i>,
    which I have always heard was the precursor of all the
    Murray Guide Books. Would that all guide books
    were written with such a light and amusing pen.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Festa&rdquo; at Cadiz came to an end like all other
    &ldquo;Festas,&rdquo; and so did my brief term of command, for
    in the first days of August our newly appointed
    Captain, Commander the Honourable Maurice Bourke,
    superseded me, and I reverted to my old duties of
    First-Lieutenant. Again Providence had been kind to
    the <i>Surprise</i>, as our new Captain was one of the most
    charming and beloved of men. At one time his career<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> was almost a synonym for good luck. Everything had
    gone well with him. Very good-looking, with all the
    charm of the best sort of Irishman, one of the smartest
    and ablest officers afloat, he seemed inevitably destined
    to hold in turn every high command that the Navy in
    those days could offer. And then came a run of the
    most persistent ill-fortune. Not long after I left the <i>Surprise</i> she was badly in collision with a merchant
    steamer. It was not in the very remotest way the
    fault of the Captain, but at the same time it was an
    unpleasant incident. A very few years afterwards he
    was Flag-Captain to Sir George Tryon, when that
    terrible <i>Victoria</i> and <i>Camperdown</i> collision occurred,
    which cost so much loss of life, and, moreover, so much
    loss of reputation. Again, poor Maurice Bourke could
    not be blamed, but none the less he was the Captain of
    the ship in fault. He was unlucky for the third time
    later on, when Senior Officer in the <i>Newfoundland</i>,
    though the mishap to his ship was trifling. Unfortunately,
    his health had suffered greatly by the long
    immersion he had undergone, and the shock he had
    sustained, at the sinking of the <i>Victoria</i>, and he died,
    alas! at a comparatively early age. If it is ever true
    to write of a man, that he died regretted by all who
    knew him, I think it might be written of him. To me
    he was the kindest of friends and captains, and I was
    one of the very many who mourned his loss sincerely.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our new Captain&rsquo;s earliest jobs was to convey
    the Duke and Duchess to Venice, and we lay, I think,
    for nearly a fortnight off the Lido. It really was an
    ideal way of visiting Venice, and though I had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> there before, and have seen it many times since, it
    certainly was one of my happiest remembrances of
    that most entrancing of cities. To begin with, the
    surroundings of the Lido make an ideal berth for a
    yacht. Being outside the mouth of the Grand Canal,
    there is plenty of air, and the open water is clearer and
    cleaner than that in the narrower parts of the canal
    system. It is not only a convenient place from which
    to go sight-seeing, but it is near the famous bathing-place.
    Moreover, there was a very pleasant party on
    board. The guests were Prince George of Wales,
    Princess Charlotte of Saxe Meiningen, and the late
    Duke of Argyll; Lady Monson, then the Honourable
    Mrs. Monson, being in attendance on the Duchess.</p>
<p>Another very delightful trip the <i>Surprise</i> made was
    to the Riviera, to enable the Duchess to see something
    of her numerous relations and friends who were wintering
    there. Cannes, Nice and Monte Carlo at that
    time literally swarmed with Russians. It seemed as if
    half the Imperial Family had quartered themselves on
    that sunny coast. The Russian aristocracy, like any
    other conglomeration of individuals, may not have
    been a faultless institution; but, individually and collectively,
    I have always found the members of it the
    most agreeable people in the world. Free from
    prejudice, very cosmopolitan, speaking every language
    with equal facility, and entirely (to use an American
    expression) &ldquo;without frills.&rdquo; No foreigners I have
    ever met are so easy to get on with, for they have the
    knack of putting even the shyest and most insular of
    Englishmen at his ease, and it is an additional comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> to Englishmen, who, as a rule, know no language
    except their own, to be dealing with people who speak
    our language like natives. It was at Cannes that I first
    came much into contact with Russians, but since then
    I have been attached to several Russian Missions that
    have been in London, and even now I have a few
    good friends left who have managed to escape from
    the Bolsheviks. I remember being attached to the
    Russian suite of one of the Royalties who came on a
    Mission here. There being no room at Buckingham
    Palace, they were quartered at the hotel of that name,
    but of course were expected to take their meals at the
    palace, together with the suites of the other missions
    who were representing their various countries. I
    thought it my duty to go to the hotel every day to
    see if my friends required any attention, but I might
    just as well have saved myself the trouble. The
    invariable answer to my questions as to whether they
    would like to dine or take luncheon at the palace, or
    required carriages to take them about, was a polite one
    to the effect that they could quite well look after themselves,
    and as far as conveyances were concerned they
    infinitely preferred hansoms to royal carriages. The
    principal reason why the men of the upper classes in
    Russia are so easy to get on with, is, that they are, with
    rare exceptions, gentlemen, and it is as uncommon to
    meet a vulgar snob among them as it would be to
    meet a gentleman among the same number and class of
    Germans.</p>
<p>But I must return to Cannes. No sooner had the
    Duchess arrived at Cannes than she was surrounded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> her relatives, who not only entertained her, but were
    more than kind to the officers on board. I remember
    a dinner party given for her at the Villa Venden, then
    the property of the late Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin,
    who had married the Grand Duchess Anastasie of Russia,
    sister to the Grand Duke Michael, who has lived for
    so many years in England, and is so well known and
    popular here. Among many other distinguished guests
    was the Duke of Mecklenburg&rsquo;s sister, the Grand
    Duchess Vladimir, who is also very well known in
    London and Paris. The Duke of Mecklenburg, who
    was compelled by ill-health always to winter on the
    Riviera, was, though a German, a gentleman, an almost
    unique case so far as my experience is concerned. It
    has been my misfortune to meet a great many Boches
    in my time, but I can truthfully say that one of the
    only gentlemen that I ever met amongst them was our
    host of that evening.</p>
<p>After dinner there was dancing, which went on until
    very late, and eventually we, the officers of the <i>Surprise</i>,
    got on board our ship in the dawn, thinking that anyhow
    after three or four hours&rsquo; sleep there would be a
    lazy morning. But we were reckoning without our
    hosts. At eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning the Duchess
    of Mecklenburg and her sister-in-law were alongside to
    tell us that they had persuaded our Duchess to take
    them all round to Monte Carlo in the <i>Surprise</i>, and
    that meanwhile they wanted some breakfast, so these
    undefeated ladies, who could not possibly have been in
    bed before four o&rsquo;clock, were four hours later making
    themselves extremely agreeable to their guests of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> night before in the tiny wardroom of the <i>Surprise</i>.
    But apparently, however lightly Russians may take
    life (they perpetually use the word &ldquo;nitschevo,&rdquo; which
    corresponds exactly to the Spanish &ldquo;mañana,&rdquo; and
    practically means that &ldquo;nothing matters&rdquo;), they certainly
    do not waste it in sleep! Even now I can recall
    the luncheon party a few hours later at the Hôtel de
    Paris. Besides the Royalties, there were present a
    number of agreeable people of every nationality, so
    what with the brightness of the surroundings, the
    gaiety of the party, and the number of different
    languages in which the general conversation was carried
    on, there resulted a sort of babel, that was very
    amusing and almost bewildering to the ordinary young
    naval officer.</p>
<p>On another occasion when the <i>Surprise</i> was in these
    waters the little ship was anchored in that lovely
    harbour of Ville-franche, midway between Nice and
    Monte Carlo, and for the moment we happened to
    have no distinguished visitors on board. Our Boatswain,
    Mr. Cunningham (he is such an old friend of
    mine that I am sure he will forgive me for relating a
    story about him), had, I thought, been cooped up too
    long on the ship, for so keen a worker was he that
    he would remain for months on board without ever
    going ashore. With great difficulty I persuaded him
    to come to Monte Carlo with me on the plea that he
    would see a new side of life that would enlarge his
    mind (this was certainly true!), and on the understanding
    that I would give him dinner and not desert
    him. I duly introduced him to the gambling-rooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> and gave him dinner, and then, as usually happens
    at Monte Carlo, we managed to miss each other and
    I lost sight of him. Of course he could not speak
    a word of anything but English, but somehow or
    another, after a series of adventures, he managed to
    find his way back to the ship just in time to get the
    anchor up next morning, and all was well. He was
    a splendid sailor, and it was a great pleasure to meet
    him again many years afterwards, first as Chief Boatswain
    of the Royal Yacht, and still later as Lieutenant
    Cunningham at Osborne College, where he directed
    the Seamanship Instruction of the Naval Cadets. But
    though he rose to those giddy heights I feel convinced
    that he never forgot his trip to Monte Carlo.</p>
<p>Yet another of the <i>Surprise&rsquo;s</i> cruises to the Riviera
    has to be mentioned. Shortly after the New Year
    of 1888 our little ship anchored off San Remo, the
    Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh being both on board.
    They had come to visit (and unhappily their visit
    turned out to be a final one) the Crown Prince of
    Prussia who was spending the winter there. He left
    San Remo shortly afterwards to become German
    Emperor for a reign of three months. The Crown
    Prince was too ill to return the visit in person, but
    I can remember the Crown Princess arriving on board
    and the manifest pleasure that it gave her to find
    herself once more on board a British man-of-war.
    Well might the odious people with whom she had
    been fated to live, call her, in derision, the &ldquo;Engländerin&rdquo;;
    we English, who have grown to know the
    Germans better, can now appreciate the fact that what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> was intended as an ill-natured sneer was, virtually, a
    compliment. By the middle of June her husband,
    the man who, had he lived, might possibly have
    changed the fate of Europe, was unfortunately dead;
    to be succeeded on the throne by his son, that half-megalomaniac,
    half-mountebank, who, as I write, has
    taken refuge in a foreign country from those who
    were once his subjects.</p>
<p>Before temporarily quitting the topic of the German
    Royal Family, I must mention that some time afterwards,
    when suffering acutely from one of the numerous
    German Invasions of Cowes which had become annual
    visitations during Regatta week, I prophetically offered
    to take £100 to £1 that I should live to see the
    German Empire broken up, and it is a lasting regret
    to me to feel that, now the cataclysm has come, I
    have altogether forgotten the layer of the bet, who,
    more than likely, is now not even alive!</p>
<p>Another Mediterranean summer was passed pleasantly
    enough in cruising, the greater part of the time in
    company with the Fleet, and then, in early September,
    I heard, to my great joy, that I had been appointed
    to the Royal Yacht <i>Victoria and Albert</i>. This meant
    not only certain promotion at the end of two years,
    but also a very pleasant time in England.</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER  VII</a></h2>
<h3>THE ROYAL YACHT</h3>
<p>At the age of thirty-two, except for my term of
    service at Greenwich and for a few short turns of
    weeks or months, I had hardly been in England since
    I first went to sea as a midshipman, so I was naturally
    delighted at getting a good spell at home before going
    abroad again as a Commander, with the prospect of
    attaining Post rank before I was forty. At that
    time, I had not the smallest intention of doing anything
    but serve steadily on in the Navy, with a fair
    chance of eventually hoisting my flag; however, as
    every philosopher knows, nobody has any idea of
    what may be in store for him, and instead of further
    spells of foreign service it turned out that I had
    practically returned to England for ever.</p>
<p>The officers of the Royal Yacht were, by tradition,
    ear-marked for promotion, the Sub-Lieutenants, who
    were appointed for one season, which practically
    amounted to only a couple of months, were duly
    promoted at the end of that time, and generally packed
    off to sea very soon, as the long half-pay period which
    existed when I was a young Lieutenant had mercifully
    come to an end. The two Lieutenants of the Yacht<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> remained for two years, and were then promoted,
    whilst the Commander became a Post-Captain at the
    end of three years.</p>
<p>And now to say something of my new brother
    officers, and the ship,&mdash;or rather ships,&mdash;in which we
    served. I joined the Royal Yacht in the autumn of
    1888 at Portsmouth, where I found my old Admiral,
    Sir J. Edmund Commerell, installed with his family
    at Admiralty House as Commander-in-Chief. I was
    delighted to have the opportunity of renewing my
    acquaintance with him and making that of Lady
    Commerell and their daughter. My old Commander
    of the <i>Narcissus</i>, the late Admiral Sir John Fullerton,
    was in command of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Yacht <i>Victoria and
    Albert</i>, with the <i>Alberta</i>, <i>Elfin</i>, and <i>Royal George</i> as
    tenders. He remained in charge of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s
    Yachts as Captain and Admiral from 1884 to the day
    of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s death, and the last duty he performed
    afloat was when, in charge of the tiny <i>Alberta</i>,
    he brought the mortal remains of the Great Queen
    from Osborne, where she died, to Portsmouth on the
    way to her last resting place at Windsor. He was, for
    some years afterwards, a Groom-in-Waiting to King
    Edward, and subsequently an extra Groom-in-Waiting
    to King George, and died a little over a year ago at
    his lovely little home at Hamble. Hamble lies up
    its own little river, which empties itself into the
    Southampton Water; it is now a fishing village, but,
    during the old wars, was a famous ship-building place,
    and many were the line-of-battleships that were
    launched from the slips there, of which traces can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> still be seen. It was an ideal place for an old sailor
    to end his days in.</p>
<p>The <i>Victoria and Albert</i> was my old Madeira acquaintance,
    and, still as beautiful as ever, and though
    some thirty years of age when I joined her, nothing
    more perfect in the way of &ldquo;lines&rdquo; had yet been
    produced by any Naval architect. Our Commander
    was Richard Poore, now Admiral Sir Richard Poore,
    and the fourth baronet of that name. In after years,
    besides being Second-in-Command of the Channel
    Fleet, he was twice a Commander-in-Chief, namely in
    Australia and at the Nore. The other Lieutenant was
    Gerald King-Harman, a splendid specimen of an
    Irishman, and brother to the well-known Member of
    Parliament of that name. He, poor fellow, knowing
    that he was suffering from a mortal disease, did his
    best to break his neck out hunting, all to no purpose;
    he died shortly after his promotion in 1889.</p>
<p>In those days the <i>Victoria and Albert</i> was only inhabited
    by a small party of caretakers except when
    she was actually on some cruise, or when the Queen
    was paying her summer visit to Osborne, during which
    time the Royal Yacht lay at Cowes in full commission.
    During the winter stay of the Court at Osborne and
    during the greater part of the year the officers lived
    on board the <i>Royal George</i>, the old hulk that had
    been the Royal Yacht in the days of George IV and
    King William, and all communication with Cowes
    was carried on either by the tenders, <i>Alberta</i> and <i>Elfin</i>,
    or by picket-boat. I loved the old hulk. We were
    very comfortable, as the officers messed in what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> been the Royal apartments. She was tiny, but had
    been built as a miniature copy of the frigates of her
    day, and had been full rigged. I believe that the
    last time she was in use as a Royal Yacht was in 1842,
    when Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort paid
    their first visit to Scotland. On that occasion the
    Royal Party embarked on board the <i>Royal George</i> at
    Woolwich, and were towed round in her to the port
    of Leith. I am not surprised, however, that Queen
    Victoria preferred to make the return voyage on board
    a steamer belonging to the General Steam Navigation
    Company, where Her Majesty found that the accommodation
    was better and more spacious than on board
    the <i>Royal George</i>.</p>
<p>During the Queen&rsquo;s winter residence at Osborne no
    leave was given, as it was never known when we might
    be required, and when the Royal Yacht lay at Cowes,
    in the summer, the officers were not allowed ashore
    until it had been finally ascertained that Her Majesty
    had no further commands for that day; but when the
    Court was not at Osborne we had a very easy time.
    The two Lieutenants used to take it in turn to go on
    leave, one of them having to live on board the <i>Royal
    George</i>, but as soon as Morning Prayers had been read
    there was little or nothing more to do, and there
    was no trouble about attending such Race Meetings as
    Sandown and Kempton, which, being on the South-Western
    Railway line, were easily reached, as indeed
    was London. At that time I belonged to the Naval
    and Military Club, and a very cheerful place it was,
    especially for a sailor. There was one corner of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> huge smoking-room,&mdash;which is still, I believe, called
    Besika Bay Corner,&mdash;where one was sure to meet one&rsquo;s
    old comrades and their soldier friends who had
    garrisoned Malta in the late &rsquo;seventies and early &rsquo;eighties.
    And so the time passed agreeably enough, interspersed,
    as it was, with a good many trips across the Channel.
    In the middle of November the Prince of Wales embarked
    on board the Royal Yacht and was conveyed
    to Flushing to meet, the then, recently widowed
    Empress Frederick. Her Imperial Majesty arrived on
    board with her three daughters and crossed to Port
    Victoria, where she was met by Queen Victoria and
    most of the members of the Royal Family, and
    travelled with them to Windsor. The winter season,
    commencing, as was general, in the middle of December,
    was a busier one than usual, for the Empress Frederick
    had accompanied her mother to Osborne, and there
    was a great deal of running to and fro to convey the
    various members of the Royal Family backwards and
    forwards.</p>
<p>In the middle of February 1889 the Queen left
    Osborne, and some ten days later the Empress Frederick
    crossed in the yacht to Flushing, with her daughters,
    on her way home. In early March Queen Victoria
    embarked for Cherbourg <i>en route</i> to Cimiez. The <i>Victoria and Albert</i> was escorted across the Channel by
    a veritable procession of yachts, including the <i>Osborne</i>, <i>Alberta</i>, <i>Enchantress</i> (the Admiralty Yacht), and the <i>Galatea</i> (the Trinity House boat). Her Majesty returned
    to England in April.</p>
<p>Our next trip was at the end of June when we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> sent to Antwerp to embark the Shah. I remember
    the late King of the Belgians came to Antwerp to see
    him off, so I suppose that Oriental Potentate had
    been officially visiting Belgium before coming to
    England.</p>
<p>The Shah was attended by Sir H. Drummond
    Wolff, then H.M. Minister at Teheran, and Sir H.
    Rawlinson, who were with him during the whole of his
    visit. He also had an enormous retinue of Persians
    for us to embark. Some of them, such as Ali Asmer
    Asgher Khan, Amin us Sultan, the Grand Vizier, and
    Prince Malcom Khan, the Persian Minister, and a few
    others, were no doubt very distinguished men; but the
    tail end of the suite seemed to me to consist principally
    of what the Bluejackets used to call &ldquo;scallawags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 1st July we duly arrived at Gravesend,
    where the Prince of Wales boarded us, to welcome the
    Shah, and then up the Thames we went and the real
    fun began. The river, of course, swarmed with
    excursion steamers, and the one idea of the excursionists
    was to try and keep alongside the Royal Yacht, and as
    near as possible, so as to get a sight of the Shah. This
    congestion of passenger boats, all overcrowded with
    sight-seers was extremely dangerous, and as the smallest
    collision would have sunk any of those lightly-built
    craft, an accident would have resulted in an appalling
    loss of life. As usual the men in charge of these
    boats behaved very badly and took great risks, but
    it meant a harvest for them in the shape of tips
    from their passengers, and human nature being what
    it is, it would be ridiculous to blame them, and as,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> moreover, thanks to good luck, no accident happened,
    there was no harm done. The Royal party eventually
    landed in a sort of glorified steam-launch at Westminster
    Steps.</p>
<p>In the middle of July, the Queen went, as usual, to
    Osborne, but her visit there was broken by a journey
    she had to make to London to enable her to be present
    at the wedding of Princess Louise of Wales and the
    late Duke of Fife on the 27th. Two days after Her
    Majesty&rsquo;s return to Osborne, the Royal Yacht conveyed
    the Shah there to take leave of the Queen, and thence
    to Cherbourg. Meanwhile, a large Fleet had assembled
    at Spithead, under the command of Sir J. Edmund
    Commerell, Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth, so
    that the Shah on his way to Cowes might be enabled
    to see something of the British Navy. I am bound to
    say that he did not appear to be in the least impressed.
    He firmly declined to come on deck, and obviously
    disliked the noise of the salute. In fact, he took no
    notice of the Fleet whatever. My old friend, the late
    Mr. Bennett Burleigh, the well-known War Correspondent
    of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, had by some mysterious
    means managed to smuggle himself on board the Royal
    Yacht. I have an idea that the late General Sir John
    McNeil, then on board as one of the Queen&rsquo;s Equerries,
    had rather connived at his presence, for he and Sir John
    had been old cronies and campaigners together. However,
    being there, he behaved with the most commendable
    tact, and had not ventured near the saloon where
    the Shah had ensconced himself, and consequently had
    to rely on second-hand information. I, being on duty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> was in the immediate vicinity, and so was duly pumped
    by my friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a splendid sight the salute was! I am sure
    the Shah must have been greatly impressed. What
    did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I have already written, the Shah paid no attention
    whatever to the Fleet, but, thinking that he ought
    certainly to have made some sort of remark, I gravely
    answered that His Majesty had said: &ldquo;Wah, Wah,
    Allah is great, and the English are a mighty nation,&rdquo;
    which I thought would do just as well for the readers
    of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> as anything else. I am rather
    afraid that Mr. Burleigh was too old a hand to be
    caught, and greatly doubt whether the imaginary
    ecstasies of the Shah were ever published.</p>
<p>That particular season at Cowes was an interesting
    one, for it was in 1889 that the Kaiser made his first
    descent on Cowes in the shape of a visit to his grandmother,
    Queen Victoria. He arrived on August 3rd,
    and with his usual arrogance, or perhaps to save
    himself from paying their board in Germany while he
    was in England, he brought over an immense and
    entirely unnecessary suite. Osborne, and all its little
    dependencies, were strained to the utmost to house
    this swarm of locusts, and even then an overflow
    party had to be put up on board the Royal Yacht.
    This was the first occasion that I had ever come into
    contact with any number of Germans, and I have
    heartily disliked them ever since. To my mind, even
    on a pre-war standard, there is nothing good to be
    said about them. I detest all their ways and works,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> their eternal bows, and clicking of heels, and the
    equally eternal shaking of hands, and impertinent
    inquiries about one&rsquo;s digestion. Moreover, they have
    the odious habit of leaving sheaves of visiting cards in
    all directions. We were thirteen officers on board the
    Royal Yacht, and when our unbidden guests insisted
    on leaving a card apiece upon us it literally made up
    one or more packs to be littered about. In view of
    our present experience of them, I think that I can
    congratulate myself on a certain amount of prescience
    in the detestation with which they, one and all,
    inspired me so many years ago.</p>
<p>Other visitors, temporarily lodging on board the
    Royal Yacht, were Admiral of the Fleet Sir Geoffrey
    Hornby, who was in attendance on the young Kaiser
    during his visit, Sir Henry Keppel and Captain Stephenson,
    both of whom were in attendance on the Prince
    of Wales.</p>
<p>The whole visit was not only an interesting one, but
    made a very picturesque show from a naval point of
    view. The Emperor arrived in his yacht with an
    escorting squadron of the German Fleet (then very
    much in its infancy), one of the squadron, a cruiser
    named the <i>Irene</i>, being commanded by his brother,
    Prince Henry. There was a huge Fleet at Spithead,
    and Cowes was, if possible, more full of yachts than
    ever, and in addition there were anchored in the roads
    a few British battleships and torpedo-boats, one of
    these small craft being commanded by H.R.H. Prince
    George of Wales. The Prince and Princess of Wales
    were, of course, on board the Royal Yacht at Osborne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> at the usual moorings just inshore of the <i>Victoria and
    Albert</i>.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales went out in the <i>Osborne</i> to
    meet the Emperor and his squadron, and, on his way,
    his yacht was most shamefully mobbed by a horde of
    excursion steamers that had been hired for the occasion
    by the holiday folk who very naturally infest the Isle
    of Wight and South Coast at that season. The Commander
    of the <i>Osborne</i> only succeeded in keeping them
    off at a less dangerous distance by threatening to pump
    water over them with the steam fire hose.</p>
<p>The Prince went on board the Kaiser&rsquo;s yacht as
    soon as she arrived, and later landed at Osborne to be
    with the Queen when the Emperor arrived at Osborne
    House. The usual Cowes Regatta was in full swing
    during the week or so that the visit lasted, and
    such crowds filled the streets that there literally was
    barely standing room in the queer little town. The
    only functions I remember were a parade review
    of the German seamen that was held in the grounds at
    Osborne, a dinner party that was given by the Queen
    to the officers of the German Fleet on board the <i>Victoria
    and Albert</i>, and a review of the Fleet by the Emperor.
    As concerns the review, the Kaiser and his brother,
    Prince Henry of Prussia, came on board the <i>Victoria
    and Albert</i>, where the Prince and Princess of Wales and
    all the members of the Royal Family at Osborne had
    already established themselves, and the yachts then
    proceeded to pass through the lines of the Fleet at
    Spithead. The ships were &ldquo;manned&rdquo; in the usual
    way and salutes were fired. The Royal Yacht then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> anchored in the vicinity of the <i>Howe</i>, which battleship
    was flying the flag of the Commander-in-Chief, Sir J.
    Edmund Commerell, to enable the Admirals and
    Captains to come on board and be presented to the
    Emperor. It was a fine show for those days, and the
    Fleet, including, as it did, thirty-eight First Class
    Torpedo-boats, was flying altogether one hundred and
    twelve pennants. I remember well the ill-concealed
    envy exhibited by the Kaiser, his brother, and their
    surroundings, for in those days the German Navy was
    a very small affair. Meanwhile, Queen Victoria, on
    the little <i>Alberta</i>, steamed through the lines of the
    German Fleet, an operation which did not take long,
    as they numbered just under a dozen, great and small.</p>
<p>The dinner on board was beautifully done by the
    servants who were sent from Osborne for the purpose,
    and during its progress I, as one of the least important
    of the hosts, found myself seated between two German
    officers, more or less of the same insignificant rank as
    myself. In the process of making conversation during
    the long dinner and evening, I did glean one piece
    of information that delighted me. Somehow, the topic
    of Marryat and his naval novels cropped up, and to
    my great astonishment I discovered that these Germans
    could have passed a very searching examination in
    Marryat, and had Mr. Midshipman Easy, and the
    immortal Boatswain, Mr. Chucks, at their finger-ends.
    When I expressed surprise at this, they confessed that,
    having no naval literature of their own, they had to
    fall back on ours. There was yet another surprise in
    store for me later on, when I was to see these perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> examples of officers and gentlemen (?) filling their
    pockets with the cigars that were handed to them to
    smoke! However, all these little incidents are specimens,
    I suppose, of what their admirers call &ldquo;German
    thoroughness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the German Invasion had come to an end,
    Cowes began to empty itself, and the Royal Yachts and
    the guardship (there was always a guardship in the
    roads when the Queen was at Osborne), were left in
    almost solitary grandeur, and now that there was room
    to move about freely, Cowes became quite a pleasant
    place. Our duties were not very exacting. There were
    occasional return trips to Southampton and Portsmouth
    to bring over or take back the Queen&rsquo;s visitors in one
    of the tenders, and every other day it was my duty to
    walk up to Osborne, take luncheon with the household
    and ascertain whether her Majesty had any commands.</p>
<p>About the middle of September the Court moved to
    Balmoral, the Queen crossing as usual in the <i>Alberta</i>,
    and we officers took up our quarters again on board the <i>Royal George</i>, the great bulk of the ship&rsquo;s company, as
    usual, going back to the dockyard to work as riggers.
    And so ended my first season at Cowes as a Lieutenant
    of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Yacht.</p>
<p>In December, when the Court as usual moved to
    Osborne, leave came to an end, and the constant trips
    across the Solent conveying Her Majesty&rsquo;s numerous
    royal guests,&mdash;including, amongst many others, the
    Empress Eugenie,&mdash;kept us busy until the return of the
    Court to Windsor in the middle of January. A
    month later the Royal Yacht embarked Her Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> for her usual spring visit to the Continent, and at the
    end of April we were at Flushing again to embark the
    Queen on her return to Windsor.</p>
<p>Our next trip was on a rather more extended scale,
    as in the middle of July we were ordered to embark
    the Empress Frederick, and her two (then) unmarried
    daughters, Princesses Victoria and Margaret, and convey
    them to Gibraltar, where they proposed being transported
    to the <i>Surprise</i> for conveyance to Athens, the reason for
    the visit being, I believe, the expected accouchement
    of the other daughter, the Duchess of Sparta, a lady
    of whom, as Queen of the Hellenes, the British public
    has heard a good deal since. By the 2nd of August
    we were back at Cowes again for the usual summer
    season, and two days later the Kaiser arrived in the <i>Hohenzollern</i>, accompanied by the inevitable Prince
    Henry. This visit was of a more private nature than
    the one of the year before, and, I expect greatly to the
    relief of all concerned on this side of the North Sea,
    only lasted for four days. During a part of the season
    there was an Austrian squadron lying at Spithead,
    commanded by an Admiral Hincke, the Archduke
    Karl Stephan being in command of one of the ships
    of the squadron, the <i>Kaiser Franz Josef</i>. While this
    squadron was in the vicinity of Cowes, Queen Victoria
    inspected it by steaming between the lines in the <i>Alberta</i>.</p>
<p>About the middle of August the Empress Eugenie
    arrived at Osborne on a visit to the Queen, and thereby
    hangs a tale:</p>
<p>The Queen had decided to have some private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> theatricals and <i>tableaux vivants</i>, organised at Osborne
    during the Empress&rsquo;s stay there, and on the evening the
    performance was given a few notabilities in the neighbourhood
    and some of the officers of the Royal Yacht
    had the honour of being invited. The day before the
    entertainment took place I received a sudden order to
    go to Osborne, and on arriving there was told that one
    of the dramatis personæ had suddenly been taken ill,
    and that I was to take that gentleman&rsquo;s place. Mercifully
    there were no words to learn, and I only had to
    dress up and form one of the representants of the
    various pictures. The three most elaborate displays,
    with which the performance ended, were a series of large
    set-pieces representing Twelfth Night (in a general and
    not a Shakespearean sense), Queen Berengaria interceding
    with King Edward for the Burghers of Calais, and
    the Garden Scene from <i>Faust</i>. All these pictures were
    very beautifully &ldquo;dressed,&rdquo; and the great Mr. Clarkson
    arrived from London to make up the faces of the performers
    and arrange their wigs. In &ldquo;Twelfth Night,&rdquo;
    Princess Louise Marchioness of Lorne, Princess Henry
    of Battenberg, Lady Feodor Gleichen, and one or two
    other ladies were amongst the revellers, to say nothing of
    more than an equal number of men. This one I saw from
    the front, and though very pretty, I remember thinking it
    was a little crowded. In the next I took a part, and so
    can give no opinion upon it. Princess Louise again
    was in the Tableau, and made a very beautiful Queen
    Berengaria; the late Sir Henry Ponsonby, in a magnificent
    suit of armour from Windsor, was the King;
    Lord Stamfordham, then Colonel Arthur Bigge, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> one of the Burghers; Colonel Sir H. Legge, then
    Captain Harry Legge, and I were amongst the knights
    in attendance, and Mr. Victor Biddulph, who died quite
    recently, wonderfully made up as to tonsure, was the
    attendant priest.</p>
<p>In the Garden Scene from <i>Faust</i>, Princess Beatrice
    took the part of Marguerite, with Lady Southampton
    as Martha; Harry Legge was Mephistopheles, whilst
    I, in my capacity as an understudy, had to represent
    Faust. I am afraid that this tableau was not altogether
    a success, for as soon as the curtain went up, I heard
    the Empress Eugenie, who was naturally seated next
    to the Queen, ask in a very audible voice, &ldquo;Mais, qui
    est, donc, ce petit Faust?&rdquo; The unfortunate &ldquo;petit
    Faust&rdquo; in question shook to such an extent with
    suppressed laughter that the whole stage quivered, and
    the picture in general could only be described as wobbly.</p>
<p>After the performance there was a great supper for
    the dramatis personæ and the guests in general, and I
    am bound to say that, though I went to Osborne with
    considerable trepidation, I finished up by spending an
    extremely agreeable evening.</p>
<p>A week or two later, at the end of August, the
    Queen left for Balmoral, and the following week I was
    promoted to the rank of Commander.</p>
<p>And so, in September 1890, after about twenty
    years&rsquo; service as boy and man, I became, for quite a
    considerable time, a free agent, as a Commander on
    the munificent half-pay of eight shillings per diem,&mdash;and
    a very pleasant time it was. In the spring of
    1892 I had been fortunate enough to be elected a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> member of the Turf Club,&mdash;in those days, to my
    mind, much the most agreeable Club in London. The
    Turf Club was then, perhaps, at its very best.
    Socially it was extremely pleasant, the majority of
    the members being principally engaged in amusing
    themselves. All the best of the racing men belonged
    to it, and nearly all the men prominent in sport of all
    kinds made it a place of rendezvous, whilst in addition,
    it was much patronised by the leading Foreign Diplomatists,
    and our own Politicians of the best sort. A
    good deal of whist was played there, and nothing was
    more usual than to cut into a rubber where the other
    players might well be a Foreign Ambassador, some
    notable Politician, and the youngest-joined Guardsman,
    so altogether it was eminently many-sided. Though,
    from its name, most people had an idea that no conversation
    ever took place there except on the one topic
    of racing, nothing was further from the fact. When
    such men as the late Duke of Devonshire, Lord
    Russell of Killowen, and Lord James of Hereford (to
    mention only a very few) were constantly,&mdash;indeed
    almost daily,&mdash;to be met there, it was pretty obvious
    that there were other interests as well as racing connected
    with the Club, and that it was something more
    than merely a place for idle men of fashion. In
    those times it was a very late establishment, for,
    on most nights, returning from balls and parties, a
    number of us would put in there for an hour or so
    before going to bed.</p>
<p>Another very delightful Club that  had just  been
    established, though one of a very different nature, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> the unfortunately short-lived Amphitryon Club in
    Albemarle Street. It was started by a number of
    well-known men, prominent amongst whom were the
    late Lord Randolph Churchill, the Marquis de Soveral,
    and the present Lord Chaplin. Though on the lines
    of the best sort of French Café, it was a Club to the
    extent that there was a small entrance fee and subscription,
    and a ballot for members. The Maître d&rsquo;Hôtel,
    one Emile Aoust, had been at Bignon&rsquo;s and thoroughly
    understood how to provide his clients with the best
    of everything. As well as the restaurant downstairs,
    there were several apartments upstairs, where large and
    small private dinner parties could be given, and had it
    only been really well managed it might have lasted for
    ever. Unfortunately Emile, though he thoroughly
    understood food, knew nothing about finance, and after
    about five years of existence the Club had not much to
    show except debts. Consequently the establishment had
    to be wound up, and a grievous pity it was. It was a
    delightful place for dinners or luncheons, and, moreover,
    members were allowed to entertain ladies there
    for meals, so it was an enormous convenience for the
    real Londoner. The worst of Emile&rsquo;s system was
    that his prices were rather too varied. The regular
    habitués were not at all badly treated, for, though
    it was very expensive, the best food <i>is</i> very expensive,
    so there was not much to complain of; but occasionally,
    when dealing with members who did not understand
    his ways, his prices were really rather remarkable.
    I remember that he succeeded in losing the custom of
    a very good client by charging him sixteen shillings for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> a solitary baked apple. No doubt the apple was the
    very best of its sort, but even then, it was rather more
    than any man could stand who might happen to notice
    this detail, half-way down the long bill for a dinner for
    some eight or ten guests. However, with all his faults,
    Emile was a real artist, and I am by no means the only
    one of his old customers who constantly deplores the
    fact that he is no longer with us, and that the
    Amphitryon Club is a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Whilst on the subject of London Clubs, it was about
    this time that I was fortunate enough to survive the
    ordeal by ballot and be elected a member of the Beefsteak
    Club. The activities of that charming little
    establishment have been terribly hampered by the
    paternal legislation rendered necessary by the war, but
    when I first joined, it used to begin to fill at a much
    later hour than that at which it now empties itself, in
    these supperless times. In the past it had been essentially
    a Night Club, the Annual General Meeting being
    held about midnight, that being the sort of hour when
    the majority of members used to arrive. Perhaps it
    was at its gayest and best when, after a first performance
    at some popular theatre, the &ldquo;first-nighters&rdquo; used
    to flock in to discuss the new play that had just been
    produced, and join up with the members who had
    remained on after dinner. I can hardly remember any
    place where I have heard such &ldquo;good talk&rdquo; as I have
    there, and &ldquo;good talk&rdquo; of the most varied kind, ranging
    from frank Bohemianism to the political history of
    England in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The
    sort of typical gathering that occurs to my memory when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span> still at our old home, where the new portion of Charing
    Cross Hospital now stands, would be composed somewhat
    as follows; and though many of them have joined
    the great majority, I am sure that they are not forgotten
    by their old Club-mates. To give them the
    names by which they were best known:&mdash;Archie
    Wortley, the principal founder of the Club; the
    &ldquo;Pelican,&rdquo; the name to which Pellegrini was expected to
    answer; Arthur Blunt; Corney Grain; the &ldquo;Beetle,&rdquo;
    otherwise Harry Kemble; Johnny Giffard; that most
    delightful of men, Joe Knight, then dramatic critic of
    the <i>Morning Post</i>, and also a great bibliophile; and Joe
    Comyns Carr, perhaps the wittiest of them all. These
    have all passed away, but amongst the habitués of the
    early &rsquo;nineties there are still left such men as Willie
    Elliot, Harry Higgins, Cecil Clay, Marshall Hall, and
    one or two others. I forget exactly when we moved
    into our new premises in Green Street, Leicester Square,
    but it must have been a good many years ago, and I do
    not know that the &ldquo;talk&rdquo; in the new house is not as
    good as it was in the former one, when the survivors
    of the old gang are reinforced by Leonard Courtney,
    John Scott Montagu (now Lord Montagu of Beaulieu),
    Seymour Hicks, Perceval Landon, Charles Whibley,
    and, until his death, the deeply regretted Harry Cust,
    perhaps the most brilliant man in England.</p>
<p>Another popular personage in London Society who
    died recently and was a great frequenter of the Beefsteak
    was the late Count Benckendorff, for many years
    Russian Ambassador in London. He did not often
    leave London, and there was hardly a night that he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> not come in for an hour or so for a cigar and a chat
    before going to bed. He was always a very kind
    friend to me, and I knew him pretty well. He made
    himself extremely agreeable at the Club, and besides
    being a wonderful linguist (he really spoke English like
    an Englishman), he was a mine of information about
    every sort of subject, and I am convinced would have
    taken &ldquo;full marks&rdquo; for any &ldquo;English History
    Examination Paper,&rdquo; if he ever saw such a thing.
    Outside his own family, I am sure that in no coterie
    was his death more sincerely mourned than in that,
    composed of the members of the Beefsteak Club.</p>
<p>In the course of that winter I managed to get a little
    hunting. Lord Manners, who had married one of my
    cousins, a Miss Hamlyn Fane,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> had been lately Master
    of the Quorn, and was then living at Cold Overton,
    the well-known Leicestershire hunting-box. With the
    aid of a few hirelings and the kindness of my host
    I succeeded in condensing a good deal of sport into the
    ten days&rsquo; visit. It was at Cold Overton that I first
    made the acquaintance of the present Mrs. Asquith,
    then Miss Margot Tennant, who was hunting from
    there for the season. Our host always hacked to the
    meet, and used to place a dog-cart at the disposal of
    Miss Margot and myself. With such a companion the
    long drive to the various meets which we attended
    formed quite an agreeable part of the day&rsquo;s sport. In
    those days Miss Margot Tennant was as  brilliant a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> performer over the country as she was a conversationalist,
    and her very numerous friends will, I am sure,
    fully endorse this statement.</p>
<p>My half-pay time came to an end in the spring of
    1891, when I joined the Staff of the Naval Intelligence
    Department. This Department was quite new, and
    Captain Cyprian Bridge, my old Commander of the <i>Audacious</i>, the then Director, was only the second to
    hold the appointment, the first holder of that office
    having been Captain Hall. Curiously enough his
    son, Rear-Admiral Sir Reginald Hall, M.P., was one
    of the most conspicuous successes of the late war
    when in charge of that same Department. So completely
    civilian-ridden was the old Whitehall building
    then, that this very important Department was looked
    upon as a part of the Civil Service of the Admiralty,
    in spite of the fact that its Director was either an
    Admiral, or a very senior Captain, who had working
    under him two more Captains as Assistant-Directors,
    four Commanders as Naval Staff, and four Marine
    Officers as Marine Staff. When I went there first, I
    expected to find the work extremely interesting; but,
    as in all other offices, it soon turned out that it
    mainly consisted in a sort of regular routine. Indeed,
    during the two years which I spent there, I can only
    remember three or four really illuminating jobs which
    came my way. Towards the end of my time there,
    my particular business was to look after the Navies of
    France and Russia, as regards ships in commission and
    reserve, and building programmes. This entailed a great
    deal of reading of French newspapers and magazines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span> but with Russian literature I could not cope, and everything
    had to be translated for me. Lord Fisher was
    then on the Board as a Rear-Admiral, and in that
    capacity I suppose had to assist in the preparation of
    the Estimates. I remember being told to supply their
    Lordships with a statement of the combined strength
    of the Navies of France and Russia, against which
    had to be shown, ship by ship, our own Navy. I was
    given the hint that, the object being to wring more
    money for more ships out of the Chancellor of the
    Exchequer, I was to make out as formidable a list as
    I could of our then possible enemies. Naturally, I
    did as I was told, and no old lame duck was too
    obsolete to be trotted out for the occasion. Personally
    I was convinced that the device was too transparent
    to deceive a child, let alone such an old political hand
    as was Sir William Harcourt, the then Chancellor of
    the Exchequer. To my secret delight, my precious
    report came back with the Chancellor&rsquo;s own annotations
    on it, and very much to the point they were.
    I felt that with all the knowledge of those Fleets that
    I had at the moment, I could not have made a better
    selection of the obsolete and useless vessels than did
    the Chancellor with his blue pencil.</p>
<p>It is curious in these days to remember that in
    the early &rsquo;nineties our bugbear was a combination
    of France and Russia against us, especially from a
    Naval point of view, the German Navy being then
    still almost negligible.</p>
<p>One fine morning, on seating myself at my table,
    I found a new and rather formidable-looking volume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span> awaiting me, to be dealt with in the ordinary course
    of the day&rsquo;s work. It turned out to be Mahan&rsquo;s <i>Influence of Sea Power on History</i>, and though the book
    itself had been completed at least a year before, I fancy
    that mine was almost the first copy to reach England
    from America. It being my duty to read it, I commenced
    at once, and except for a pause at luncheon time,
    never put it down until I had devoured the whole
    work. This task having been performed, I at once
    went to see my Chief and told him that, whether
    he could spare the time or not, it was absolutely
    incumbent upon him to read it himself, as, in my
    judgment, the general theory that the book inculcated
    was so admirably expounded that it was of the greatest
    value to any one who was entrusted with a portion
    of the care of the defences of the British Empire.
    My Chief complied with my request, and that great
    work and its successors have become classics, not only
    for the navies of the world, but also for the general
    readers of all nations.</p>
<p>All this time I was rapidly developing into a
    complete Cockney, and thank Heaven I have been
    a confirmed one ever since. Out of office hours there
    were pleasant luncheons either at the Amphitryon or
    at one&rsquo;s friends&rsquo; houses, and a possible week-end
    visit, though week-end visits in those days were few
    and far between, the fashion for them having hardly
    come in.</p>
<p>The very pleasantest dinners I can remember, were
    then given in a corner house of Great Cumberland
    Place by one of my kindest friends, Consuelo Duchess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> of Manchester. She had not only a passion for
    entertaining, but was a wonderfully successful entertainer.
    When I first made her acquaintance, she was
    no longer very young, but still a very pretty woman
    (in her youth I believe she had been quite lovely).
    But what is almost as attractive as beauty is wit,
    and that she possessed. Quick as lightning, seeing
    the humorous side of everything, she also had a
    fund of American and Cuban stories which used to
    delight us all. The usual London dinner party
    generally breaks up about 11. Hers often lasted till
    the small hours, for when the early birds amongst
    her guests had taken their flight at about the usual
    time, the rest of us gravitated towards the piano,
    and there our hostess used to enchain us literally
    for hours, for she was an admirable musician, and
    when not playing would be telling us stories. The
    last two or three men in the party were usually
    turned into the street in a little group about three
    in the morning. One of her recipes for a successful
    London dinner party I well remember. She said
    there were three indispensable ingredients&mdash;a Duchess,
    a Beauty, and a ham! Alas! she died long before
    her time in 1909, and, short as is the memory of
    the world, her friends still miss her, not only out
    of genuine affection, but because, with her the gaiety,
    if not of nations, at any rate of a large section of
    London cosmopolitan Society, became partially eclipsed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another very kind hostess of mine about that
    time was Lady Georgina Curzon, who died shortly
    after the termination of the South African War.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span> In those days she and her husband, the present
    Lord Howe, entertained principally at the charming
    little villa residence, Woodlands, that they had made
    for themselves in the neighbourhood of Uxbridge.
    Lady Georgina, who was a very fine whip, as well
    as a good horsewoman, used to delight in driving
    a coach-load of friends to all the neighbouring race
    meetings, such as Kempton, Sandown, Windsor and
    Hurst Park, all of which were within comfortable
    driving distance from Woodlands. The parties were
    not exclusively for racing, for, looking over an old
    photograph book, I came across a group which included,
    amongst others, Jean and Édouard de Reszke. Indeed,
    I am not sure that I did not meet these accomplished
    brothers for the first time at her house. Later on,
    when her husband, the present Lord Howe, had
    succeeded to the title, they entertained on a very
    large scale at Gopsall, where I was also a constant
    guest.</p>
<p>Lady Georgie, as her friends always called her,
    was a real personality. She combined great physical
    energy and strength (she was a most fearless rider
    to hounds, and no day in Leicestershire was too long
    for her) with the brains and driving-power of the
    Churchills. She threw herself into the work of running
    the Yeomanry Hospital that was started during
    the South African War with the same boundless energy
    that always characterised her. Principally owing to
    her exertions it was most successfully conducted, and
    though she was really in failing health at the time,
    nothing would induce her to give up her work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span> and she died shortly after the Peace was signed. No
    more gallant spirit ever existed.</p>
<p>Early in March 1893, the late Rear-Admiral
    Stephenson, who has been mentioned before in these
    Recollections, hoisted his flag as Commander-in-Chief
    of the Pacific Station at Portsmouth, the <i>Royal Arthur</i>,
    then a brand-new cruiser, being his flagship. Somewhere
    about the end of the month, I received a message
    from Prince Louis of Battenberg, who was then Naval
    Adviser to the Inspector-General of Fortifications,
    informing me that the Prince of Wales desired me
    to go to Portsmouth in attendance, as His Royal
    Highness was losing his regular Naval Equerry
    in the person of Admiral Stephenson. The occasion
    was the inspection of the <i>Royal Arthur</i>, before that
    ship sailed for the Pacific. I duly got myself into
    uniform and met the Prince at Victoria Station.
    Prince Louis of Battenberg also went down. He
    had been Second in Command to the Admiral when
    the latter commanded the old <i>Dreadnought</i>, so it was
    quite in the fitness of things that he should travel
    to Portsmouth with the Prince to wish his old Captain
    good-bye. After the inspection, just before getting into
    the train to return to London, Prince Louis told me,
    to my intense surprise, that His Royal Highness had
    deputed him to tell me that he wished me to join
    his Staff as one of his Equerries-in-Waiting. So
    complete was my ignorance of anything connected
    with Court appointments that I told Prince Louis
    that, while being greatly honoured, I felt obliged
    to decline as I was compelled to go on steadily at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> my profession, being too poor to leave the Service
    and live permanently in England. I then learned,
    what I had no notion of until that time, that the
    post of Equerry carried a salary with it, which, in
    addition to my half-pay, would be quite equal to
    anything I could earn as Commander in the Navy,
    and that the Prince was quite content that I should
    remain in the Navy, and if necessary serve again
    in order to keep my name on the active list. Naturally,
    having learnt this, my only cause for hesitation
    vanished into thin air, so, to my great delight, I
    was duly appointed as Equerry-in-Waiting, and left
    the Admiralty, where I had served for about two
    years.</p>
<p>For the next seventeen years, until the day of
    his death&mdash;to me the saddest day I have ever known&mdash;I
    remained on his Staff as Equerry, and took my regular
    turn in waiting; and was thus a personal servant to
    the kindest and most considerate of masters that ever
    a man was fortunate enough to serve. From the
    late King and his family, during all those years,
    and in the years that have passed since, I received,
    and indeed still continue to receive, such unfailing
    kindness that I do not propose even to dwell on
    it; it would be hard to write on the subject without
    expressing a gratitude that, on paper, might almost
    appear fulsome.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>
<h3>EQUERRY TO THE PRINCE OF WALES</h3>
<p>I came into waiting on the Prince of Wales for the
    first time in May 1893, and one of the interesting
    minor events which happened during that month was
    the début of the famous cutter yacht, <i>Britannia</i>, who
    sailed her maiden race with her illustrious owner on
    board. It was not very easy for the Prince, with all
    his multifarious engagements, to find two spare days
    in the middle of the London Season, and indeed he
    was very seldom able to be on board his yacht except
    during the Cowes week, and in the early spring when
    visiting the Riviera. But the <i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> début at the
    Royal Thames Regatta was really something of an
    occasion, for at that time very great public interest
    was taken in yacht racing, and for three or four consecutive
    seasons the number of big racing cutters was
    abnormally large. Additional importance was attached
    to her behaviour in her first race, owing to the fact that
    the <i>Britannia</i> was known to be almost on the same
    lines as the <i>Valkyrie</i>, which later in the year was to
    race on the other side of the Atlantic for the America
    Cup. We had two good days&rsquo; racing on the Thames, and
    after very close finishes the <i>Britannia</i> beat the <i>Valkyrie</i> two days running. These two yachts encountered
    each other on many occasions; it was a near thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span> between them, but on the whole the <i>Britannia</i> was very
    slightly the better boat of the two.</p>

    </div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst on the subject of Yacht Racing, for those
    who are interested in that sport, it may as well be
    stated here that the <i>Britannia</i> was probably the most
    successful large racing cutter ever put into the water.
    Built on the Clyde by Messrs. Henderson, designed
    by Watson, and in the charge, as she was during her
    racing career, of a very strong combination of talent
    in the person of Mr. Willy Jameson and the late John
    Carter her skipper, she competed (and on the whole
    had the best of it), against one older crack racer the <i>Iverna</i>; five boats of her own year, namely the <i>Valkyrie</i>, <i>Satanita</i>, <i>Calluna</i>, <i>Vigilant</i> and <i>Navahoe</i>; (these two last
    were American boats, the <i>Vigilant</i> having been the
    successful defender of the America Cup); and two
    later English boats, the <i>Aurora</i> and <i>Ailsa</i>. It was
    not until the German Emperor&rsquo;s large cutter, <i>Meteor</i>,
    appeared on the scene, four years later, that she had
    to give up her pride of place, and could be said to have
    been definitely outbuilt, and after all <i>Meteor</i> was also
    of Watson design, and was in fact a merely enlarged <i>Britannia</i>.</p>
<p>I was in waiting again in August when the Prince
    and Princess of Wales were in residence on board
    the Royal Yacht, <i>Osborne</i>, at Cowes. There were
    some six or seven days&rsquo; hard racing under the
    auspices of the Royal Yacht Squadron, the Royal
    London Club at Cowes, and the Royal Victoria Club
    at Ryde. The Prince, at this holiday season, could
    race to his heart&rsquo;s content, and all the best-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> habitués of Cowes, female and male, were in turn invited
    on board the yacht; and as, in addition, the whole
    Royal party of the <i>Osborne</i> were almost invariably
    sailing in the <i>Britannia</i>, it can be easily supposed that
    she carried more passengers than did most racing
    yachts; but this fact certainly did not interfere with
    her sailing qualities, for she was wonderfully successful.</p>
<p>At the end of the Ryde week the Prince left Cowes
    for his usual cure at Homburg, and I was left in charge
    of the <i>Britannia</i> while she was completing the round
    of the Regattas on the Western Ports. This arrangement
    took place for two or three years running, and,
    as far as I was personally concerned, nothing could
    have been more delightful. The Prince, with that
    extraordinary consideration that he always displayed
    towards the members of his Staff, used to allow me to
    take a companion with me. One year it was the late
    Lord Hardwicke, then Lord Royston, who was my
    shipmate. On another occasion it was my friend,
    Hugh Tyrrwhitt. It was immense fun. As soon as
    the Solent Regatta came to an end the whole fleet of
    racing yachts, big and small, used to start under
    cruising canvas to the westward, for the Regattas
    held successively at Weymouth, Torquay and Dartmouth,
    to finish the season at Plymouth. At each
    place the town and neighbourhood was <i>en fête</i> for their
    Regatta week, which was for them the greatest week
    of the year. Various cruising yachts used to accompany
    the fleet. Lord Ormonde (who, sad to relate, has
    died since these lines were written), then Vice-Commodore
    of the Royal Yacht Squadron, used generally to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span> come round with his family and a few friends. The <i>Iverna</i>, Mr. John Jameson&rsquo;s yacht, usually carried not
    only Mr. Willy Jameson, <i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> head jockey, but
    also his charming wife, Mrs. Jameson, the sister of
    Field-Marshal Earl Haig.</p>
<p>The result of all this was that at the end of a long
    day&rsquo;s racing, one could have the cheeriest of dinners
    on board the various yachts, and in fact there were
    few pleasanter ways of spending the month of August.
    The Regattas usually came to an end early in September
    just in time to enable one to go to Yorkshire for the
    Doncaster Races.</p>
<p>Doncaster Races for some years running meant, as
    far as I was concerned, being one of a very pleasant
    party that used to assemble yearly at Escrick, the late
    Lord Wenlock&rsquo;s place not far from York, as the guests
    of the late Mr. Jack Menzies and his wife, who, a few
    years ago, married, for her second husband, one of my
    colleagues, Colonel Sir George Holford.</p>
<p>Naturally, the composition of the party varied slightly
    from year to year, but there was always a certain
    number of the same people, especially as regards the
    men, for the really keen racing men never missed the
    St. Leger. It is too sad a task to give their names,
    for so many of them, like our host, are no longer
    with us; but pleasanter racing parties there never
    were, for the women and men that filled the house
    were all really keen. It was a long day for the ladies.
    We had to leave Escrick soon after eleven to catch
    the special train that conveyed us to Doncaster, and it
    used to be nearly seven o&rsquo;clock by the time we got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span> back. Those were days of high betting, and when, as
    occasionally happened at Doncaster, things were going
    badly for backers, the Escrick lot was one of those
    that contributed pretty largely to the coffers of the
    Ring; but whether it was a winning or losing week,
    nothing ever marred the cheeriness of the party.</p>
<p>Amongst other hospitable houses from which I have
    &ldquo;done&rdquo; Doncaster Races were Rufford Abbey, Lord
    Savile&rsquo;s beautiful home; Tranby Croft, the late Mr.
    Arthur Wilson&rsquo;s place, not far from Hull; and Wiseton,
    belonging to that fine soldier, General Sir J. Laycock.</p>
<p>Another month that I was very apt to be on duty
    was October, and I think that perhaps on the whole it
    was the pleasantest &ldquo;wait&rdquo; of the whole year, entailing,
    as it did, a couple of weeks at Newmarket. I really
    loved the life there. The Prince of Wales had his
    own little apartment in the Jockey Club Rooms, so
    there was no place where he could be more absolutely
    free. He generally managed to get a good deal of his
    correspondence done before his early morning ride, and
    after breakfast in the Jockey Club Room, he had
    another couple of hours at his disposal before Racing.
    The Newmarket breakfast was a very pleasant meal in
    that big, quiet room looking on to a well-kept lawn,
    and consumed with the perfectly miraculous appetite
    that is given by a canter over the Heath. There were
    generally two or three other members of the Jockey
    Club at breakfast, who had been similarly engaged,
    and one of them was almost invariably the late Lord
    Suffolk. He was always primed with the latest
    racing information, which he had succeeded in gleaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> during his morning walk, and, moreover, he was a
    wonderfully good <i>causeur</i> (I really do not know the
    exact equivalent in English, for &ldquo;talker&rdquo; does not
    convey quite the same idea). I always considered him
    to be one of the most agreeable men I ever met,
    and those who have read some of his short stories,
    mostly on the subject of Racing, will remember that
    his writings were distinguished by a remarkably pleasant
    style and a great charm of expression. There happen
    to be two admirable specimens in the Badminton Book
    on Racing.</p>
<p>Sometimes the mornings before racing were spent in
    partridge-driving in the neighbourhood; but more
    often shooting took place on the Monday or the
    Saturday of the Cesarewitch and Houghton weeks, and
    generally the intermediate week was spent in a like
    manner in the neighbourhood of Newmarket. I
    remember being in attendance during a visit that the
    Prince paid to Mr. Willy Jameson at Stowlangtoft.
    Always a good shoot, in that particular year the
    Manor fairly swarmed with partridge. But the whole
    of the country round Newmarket lends itself to sport,
    and especially to partridge-driving. Within a very
    small radius, which in these days of motors would
    literally entail only a twenty minutes&rsquo; drive, Stetchworth,
    Six Mile Bottom, Chippenham, and Cheveley could all
    be reached, and as far as the quantity of game was
    concerned, one place would be nearly as good as the
    other. Six Mile Bottom was perhaps the best partridge-driving
    ground of all, for the belts over which
    the birds were driven were so substantial and well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span> placed; the late Duke of Cambridge had it on lease
    for many years, and generally made Newmarket his
    temporary abode when shooting over the Manor.
    His Royal Highness was always very keen about the
    sport, and with the aid of one of the most perfect
    weight-carrying hacks that I ever saw, could get about
    from beat to beat without too much fatigue.</p>
<p>But to leave the neighbourhood and return to the
    little town of Newmarket itself, another feature of the
    Race weeks were the dinner parties given at the various
    houses in the town. The old fashion of dining at the
    Jockey Club Rooms had rather died out, principally
    owing to the ladies having taken to patronising Newmarket
    to such a great extent, so the Prince was in the
    habit of dining out regularly during his sojourns there,
    and was a constant guest at the houses of the late Duke
    and Duchess of Devonshire, the late Sir Daniel Cooper,
    the late Lord and Lady Cadogan, and the late Mr.
    Leopold de Rothschild. Mrs. Leo, as she was always
    called by her many friends, of whom I am glad to be
    a very old one, and her husband lived at Palace House,
    so called as a part of it was the original dwelling of
    King Charles II when he frequented Newmarket, and
    they used to give a big dinner every Wednesday night
    there during the Racing Season. Wednesday was a
    good selection, for it was generally the day of the
    most important race of the week, and there would be
    met, from the Prince downwards, all the principal
    racing men present at the meeting, with the exception of
    those who were busy entertaining parties of their own.
    From what I have written it can be easily understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span> how pleasant a month October was for the Equerry-in-Waiting,
    and in the old book of Caricatures, that lay
    in the Equerries&rsquo; Room at Marlborough House, and
    was later moved on to Buckingham Palace, was to be
    seen a cutting from an illustrated paper of a snapshot
    done of myself, seated on a shooting stool with loader
    and dog in attendance, in the act of lighting a large cigar,
    with the legend underneath it: &ldquo;An Equerry at <i>work</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another month&rsquo;s duty that fell pretty frequently
    to my turn was December which, commencing as it
    did on the Princess&rsquo; birthday (1st December) entailed
    a large Birthday Party at Sandringham. On these
    occasions the guests consisted entirely of old friends,
    and year after year the Princess&rsquo; most intimate ones,
    such as Lord, and the late Lady Ripon, Lord and Lady
    Gosford, and the &ldquo;little Admiral,&rdquo; the late Sir Harry
    Keppel, were amongst those who used to meet there.
    Occasionally there would be a special dramatic performance,
    but there was always Gottlieb&rsquo;s band to play in
    the evening, and for the men there was excellent covert
    shooting during the day.</p>
<p>For several consecutive years, commencing with
    1894, I was in attendance on the Prince in the
    month of March and the beginning of April at
    Cannes. He generally lived on board the <i>Britannia</i>,
    and, as the Riviera Regattas were in full swing
    during those weeks, there was plenty of yacht racing.
    The open-air life that could be lived at Cannes was
    invaluable to him after the long winter that generally
    ended up with part of January and practically the
    whole of February in London. Cannes was a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> pleasant place then, and there were endless dinner
    parties and gaieties of all sorts, and the Society was
    eminently cosmopolitan. To begin with, the whole
    Riviera bristled with Royalties. Queen Victoria was
    for several years in succession at Cimiez in the neighbourhood
    of Nice. The Emperor and Empress of
    Austria were more than once at Cap Martin. The
    King of the Belgians was constantly in his yacht at
    Ville-franche, and was beginning to build himself a
    villa on that lovely promontory of Cap Juan that forms
    the eastern side of the harbour. Russian Grand
    Dukes abounded. The Duke and Duchess of
    Mecklenburg-Schwerin still continued to spend their
    winters at Cannes; the Grand Duke Michael, then
    recently married to Countess Torby, had settled himself
    at the Villa Kasbec, close to his sister&rsquo;s Villa Venden.
    Countess Torby&rsquo;s father, Prince Nicholas of Nassau,
    with his wife and daughter, Countess Merenberg and
    Countess Adda Merenberg, were generally to be found
    at one of the numerous hotels in the town. Lord
    Salisbury had also built himself La Bastide, overlooking
    the little harbour of Beaulieu, where he usually spent
    a few weeks surrounded by his family, and the President
    of the French Republic, President Faure, who, since
    his official visit to St. Petersburg, had become in his
    secret heart, as well as in his own person, &ldquo;plus Royaliste
    que le Roi,&rdquo; generally took an opportunity of paying
    a visit to Queen Victoria. I had the honour of being
    introduced to Monsieur le President on three separate
    occasions. Since his famous visit to Russia he had,
    greatly to his own satisfaction, taken upon himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> what he conceived to be the true &ldquo;Royal Manner,&rdquo;
    but unfortunately he did not possess the other inherent
    appanage of Royalty, viz. the &ldquo;Royal Memory.&rdquo;
    So three times running, at comparatively short
    intervals, on presentation I was most courteously
    greeted with the same formula, (no wonder that I
    learnt it by heart!), &ldquo;Commandant, enchanté de faire
    votre connaissance; il y a longtemps que vous êtes
    auprès de son Altesse Royale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to these great personages that I have
    mentioned, three charming old ladies,&mdash;who were
    irreverently nicknamed in Paris &ldquo;La Vieille Garde,&rdquo;
    the three great beauties of the latter days of the
    Empire, the Princesse de Sagan, the Marquise de
    Gallifet and the Comtesse de Pourtalès,&mdash;were always
    there, and a number of Frenchmen, such as Vicomte
    Charles de Rochefoucault, Comte Boni de Castellane
    and le Vicomte de Rochechouart; the latter was
    President of the French Yacht Club, under the auspices
    of which we constantly raced. A good many English
    people had permanent villas there, Lord and Lady
    Brougham, for instance, in their Château Eléanore,
    famous over the whole Riviera for its beautiful gardens
    and wonderful roses, and the late Mr. and Mrs. Robert
    Vyner at Château Ste. Anne. Of Americans, too,
    there were a good many &ldquo;hardy annuals,&rdquo; the late
    Mr. Ogden Goelet and his family passed several
    winters there, principally on board the yacht, <i>White
    Lady</i>, whilst Mr. Anthony Drexel, in the <i>Margarita</i>,
    and the late Mr. Gordon Bennett, spent more of their
    time at the Monte Carlo end of the coast. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> reigning Monarchs, to say nothing of the President of
    the country itself, are foregathering on some forty
    miles or so of sea coast, it is pretty obvious that
    men of importance of various nationalities are apt to
    find it necessary to pass a few days in the same atmosphere,
    and it was at Cannes that I first began to notice
    how the Prince invariably made a point of making
    the personal acquaintance of the many distinguished
    foreigners who happened to be out there, even if only
    for a few days as birds of passage, and I was to see,
    later on, when I was in attendance on him as the
    Sovereign, how invaluable these personal acquaintances
    were. Half-an-hour&rsquo;s conversation with a man is apt
    to give a greater insight into the character than reams
    of correspondence, and this was especially the case with
    the Prince of Wales, who was endowed either by
    nature or training, or more probably by a mixture of
    both, with a memory that really was prodigious. As an
    example of this memory, I recollect on my first journey
    with him to Cannes, when he had got out at some
    wayside station to stroll about during the five minutes&rsquo;
    wait, some very obvious English gentleman bowed,
    and evidently rather expected to be recognised. His
    bow was of course returned, but on re-entering the
    railway carriage, the Prince at once asked me if I knew
    who the man was. I had never seen him in my life
    before, and so could be of no assistance. After the
    train had started again, I could see that the Prince was
    trying to place the individual, and suddenly, at the
    end of a quarter of an hour or so, he triumphantly
    exclaimed: &ldquo;I knew that I should get hold of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> name. He is a Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, and he was presented to me
    just fourteen years ago at a function at which I was
    present.&rdquo; He then proceeded to state what the
    function was, and where it had taken place. He had
    never set eyes on the man in question since!</p>
<p>After leaving Cannes, a few days were generally
    spent in Paris on the way home to see the newest
    plays, and England was reached about the middle of
    April, and from that time I was off duty until the
    Cowes season came round again in the month of
    August. In 1894 the <i>Vigilant</i>, which had successfully
    defended the America Cup against Lord Dunraven&rsquo;s <i>Valkyrie</i>, had arrived in the Roads. She had already
    met <i>Britannia</i> in several races on the Clyde when the
    latter had been very successful, and she was now to
    race with her at the headquarters of English Yacht
    Racing. One of the best races I ever witnessed was
    that between these two crack cutters and <i>Satanita</i> during the Squadron Regatta week at Cowes. The
    Prince was on board, and I am nearly sure that Prince
    George was also there on that day, and so remarkable
    a race was it that I am tempted to quote from what
    I wrote about it some years ago for one of the
    Badminton series:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;. . . The yachts (<i>Britannia</i>, <i>Satanita</i>, and <i>Vigilant</i>) were
        to start to the eastward and sail round the Isle of Wight; and
        on this occasion <i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> Royal owner and several of his
        friends were on board. <i>Satanita</i> began well, and was leading
        off Bembridge; but at the back of the island the breeze
        became paltry, and <i>Satanita</i> dropped back, while <i>Britannia</i> and <i>Vigilant</i> were engaged in a battle-royal. After getting round
        St. Catherine&rsquo;s and heading for the Needles, <i>Britannia</i> picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span> up a fresh breeze off the land, and was leading by some lengths,
        with the <i>Vigilant</i> tearing up astern of her. <i>Vigilant</i> gradually
        forged ahead, and came up inshore of <i>Britannia</i>, on her
        weather. The obvious course was to luff up and prevent her
        from forcing a passage; but, unhappily, there was not sufficient
        depth of water, so up went the <i>Britannia</i> on a shoal, and in
        another moment <i>Vigilant</i> took the ground also. The latter
        had now all the best of it, as by pulling up her centre-board
        she was able to get off almost at once, and away she went for
        the Needles with <i>Britannia</i> left on the shoal. It was a good
        ten minutes before <i>Britannia</i> was floating again, and by that
        time <i>Vigilant</i> had gained a couple of miles. However, a yacht
        race is never lost until it is won; and owing to the wind falling
        light and a useful fluke or two, by the time the Needles
        were passed the two yachts were neck and neck. The wind
        had fallen light again, and what there was blew from the
        westward, so it was a case of up helm and set spinnakers.
        All on board were now full of hope, as running in light winds <i>Britannia</i> was rather the faster of the two; so with a gentle
        westerly breeze and a fair tide to take them along, the two
        rivals headed for the mark-boat at Cowes. But hope had
        almost to be abandoned when it was seen that instead of <i>Britannia</i> having the advantage, <i>Vigilant</i> was streaking away
        as if she were in tow, while <i>Britannia</i> dropped farther and
        farther astern. <i>Vigilant</i> eventually won in hollow fashion by
        eight minutes.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Mr. W. Jameson and Carter had their suspicions about the
        cause of <i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> sluggishness, so next day she was sent over
        to Southampton to be docked, and then the cause was apparent.
        The result of her grounding was that a quantity of her copper-plating
        instead of being polished and smooth, was standing out
        in rolls, and, moreover, large pieces of rock were actually
        sticking out from her lead keel. No wonder poor <i>Britannia</i> could not sail! On the other hand, <i>Vigilant</i>, thanks to her
        centre-board keel, had got off the rocks quite uninjured.
        However, the disappointment and damage done were alike
        transitory, and two days later she was sailing as well as ever
        again. At the end of the Solent Regattas, <i>Vigilant</i> retired from
        the contest. She had sailed seventeen times against the <i>Britannia</i>, and of those races <i>Britannia</i> had won eleven out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>right.
        The rest of the season of 1894, except in mixed races,
        resolved itself into matches between <i>Satanita</i> and <i>Britannia</i>, of
        which <i>Britannia</i> won the lion&rsquo;s share.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The year 1894 was an interesting one to me as
    regards horse-racing, for a colt from Sandringham
    Stud, that good horse Florizel II, came to the fore as
    a three-year-old. Being very fond of racing, I took
    a great interest in the horses bred at Sandringham, as,
    having seen them in the earliest infancy before they
    went to Richard Marsh to be trained, it was a great
    pleasure to follow their subsequent careers. Florizel,
    who was too backward to do any good as a two-year-old,
    began his winning career as a three-year-old, at
    Ascot, when he won a couple of good weight-for-age
    races, and, later on, at Goodwood and Newmarket he
    won again.</p>
<p>But the year 1895 was more interesting still, both
    as regards yachts and thoroughbreds. The <i>Ailsa</i>, a
    new cutter belonging to Mr. Barclay Walker, came
    out to Cannes in the March of that year, and made the
    yacht-racing there more strenuous than ever. She
    was a worthy antagonist to <i>Britannia</i>, and on the
    Riviera, where the wind is apt to be light, had rather
    the best of it, but later on in England the <i>Britannia</i> more than held her own. In the early summer the
    Prince was again racing on the Thames, and pulled off
    a pretty double event, for, on anchoring after a
    winning race against <i>Ailsa</i>, a telegram was brought on
    board the <i>Britannia</i> announcing the fact that Florizel
    had won a nice race the same day. I think it was the
    big handicap at Gatwick or Manchester. Ascot of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> same year was really a &ldquo;Royal Ascot,&rdquo; for Florizel
    won the Gold Vase, and that great horse, Persimmon,
    an own brother to Florizel, made his début as a two-year-old,
    and won the most important two-year-old
    race of the meeting, the Coventry Stakes, in a
    canter.</p>
<p>But life did not consist entirely of racing and
    yachting; on the whole the greatest pleasure that I
    had in those days was, I think, the Opera. Covent
    Garden was perhaps at its zenith about then. I can
    still remember my first visit to that House when I was
    a little boy nine years old. Patti was then at the
    height of her fame and beauty, and I was lucky enough
    to hear her sing in <i>Dinorah</i>, with Graziani as the Hoel.
    Meyerbeer is quite out of fashion now, but to a child,
    loving music as I did, it was heavenly, and I know
    that I was so excited by it that I never slept a wink the
    whole night through. Later, whenever I had a chance
    on the rare occasions that I was in London, I used to
    manage to go to Covent Garden, or Her Majesty&rsquo;s
    Opera House in the Haymarket, which were both
    going at the same time, with Patti as the bright
    particular star at Covent Garden, and Christine
    Nilsson at Her Majesty&rsquo;s. Some of the castes were
    very remarkably good then. I remember <i>Don Giovanni</i> being splendidly given at Covent Garden, with
    Patti, Tamberlik and Faure in the principal parts, and
    of course I heard Nilsson as Margherita in <i>Faust</i>,
    perhaps her best rôle; and, somewhat later, I heard
    that marvellous singer, Melba,&mdash;Dame Nellie Melba, as
    she now is,&mdash;when she sang once or twice at Covent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span> Garden before she made her triumphal successes at
    Brussels and Paris. Having become famous in Paris,
    of course she became indispensable to Covent Garden,
    and, thank Heaven, her lovely voice is still to be
    heard there, and I am proud to be able to count myself
    as one of her friends. But it was only when I was
    fortunate enough to become a member of the omnibus
    box that I developed into a confirmed habitué. There
    were plenty of other distractions available, but I was
    faithful to my love of music and was there most nights
    in the week, hearing delightful operas in the greatest
    comfort. The omnibus box was designed for eight
    subscribers, but the other amusements of London
    generally cut the nightly number of occupants down to
    three or four, and sometimes indeed I was the only one
    present, and to listen to good music in solitary
    comfort, seated in a capacious arm-chair, is one of
    the pleasantest things I know. Then, too, Covent
    Garden was fashionable in the best sense of that
    detestable word. The boxes were extraordinarily
    becoming to pretty women, and through the season
    they were filled, on most nights, with all the beautiful
    women of the time, looking their best in their most
    becoming dresses and diamonds, especially if there
    happened to be an important party to follow. The
    late Sir Augustus Harris treated his subscribers and his
    public extremely well; but I am inclined to think that
    the Syndicate that succeeded him did even better.
    Before taking leave of Sir Augustus Harris, a rather
    amusing incident indirectly connected with him happened
    at one of the early Masked Balls that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span> inaugurated at Covent Garden. An old friend of
    mine, the well-known Member of Parliament, Colonel
    Claude Lowther, had a box on the Grand Tier at one
    of these entertainments, and surreptitiously introduced
    into it a wonderful dummy figure made up as Sir
    Augustus. When the dancing was at its height, a
    sudden commotion brought the dancing to a standstill,
    and there in the forefront of one of the boxes was to
    be seen a terrific combat between Claude Lowther and
    Sir Augustus, Claude evidently getting very much the
    best of it. The dancers in the parterre were in agonies
    of suspense, as Sir Augustus was deservedly a great
    popular favourite, and their suspense changed into
    horror when they suddenly saw him taken bodily off
    his feet and flung out of the box on to the dancing-floor.
    So realistic was it that the police rushed up to
    the box, and before the joke could be explained Claude
    Lowther was conducted over to Bow Street, which was
    exactly opposite. I never shall forget the shout of
    laughter that went up when the dummy was discovered
    on the floor none the worse for its fall.</p>
<p>But to turn to the musical side of Covent Garden,
    what a number of fine artists I heard there during the
    many years I was a subscriber! The brothers de
    Reszke, Maurel, Ternina, Van Rooy Plançon (who
    was, perhaps, the best <i>basse chantant</i> we ever heard),
    Caruso, Vandyck, Sammarco, Mesdames Destinn and
    Edvina, and last, but by no means least, Dame Nellie
    Melba. The four last-mentioned artists have all been
    singing during the past two seasons. When the <i>Ring</i>,
    and Wagner generally, was given, with Richter as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> conductor, and with some of his Manchester musicians
    reinforcing the orchestra, without in the least posing
    as an expert, the performances to my mind were
    infinitely better all round than they were at Bayreuth.
    One very good reason being, that the very astute
    Frau Wagner greatly preferred a cheap artist to an
    expensive one; and even to my untutored taste
    Richter was a far greater conductor than Siegfried
    Wagner, whose only recommendation, I suppose, was
    that, being his mother&rsquo;s son, he was very cheap
    indeed! As to individual performances, to my mind
    the two greatest artists of the Operatic Stage during
    my time were two men, Chaliapine and Jean de
    Reszke. The former, besides his magnificent voice and
    physique, was not only a very great actor, but was, I
    think, in Russian Opera, unsurpassable. I believe that
    he never sang at Covent Garden, but I heard him at
    Monte Carlo and many times at Drury Lane. One of
    his great rôles outside Russian Opera was Mephistofile,
    in Boito&rsquo;s opera of that name. I can see him now as
    his Satanic Majesty, with all his subjects crouched
    round him, dominating the stage in almost the exact
    pose of Rodin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Penseur.&rdquo; Jean de Reszke, who I
    knew very well, was probably at his best and greatest in
    three very different parts. He was incomparably the
    best Lohengrin I ever saw or heard on any stage, and
    the same appreciation applied to his Tristan. But
    I believe that in his secret heart and in the heyday
    of his career, his favourite part was Romeo. <i>Roméo
    et Juliette</i>, as rendered by him and Melba, with his
    big brother Édouard (as Frère Laurent) duly marrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> them, some fifteen or twenty years ago, used to fill
    Covent Garden to its very roof. It is the fashion
    nowadays to decry Gounod&rsquo;s music as being too sugary,
    and obvious, and all the rest of it; but, none the less,
    sung as it was by those great artists it used to delight
    a great many of us.</p>
<p>About this time I was anxious to put off the date at
    which I would inevitably be forced to retire from the
    Service, so I applied to the Admiralty for employment
    during the yearly man&#339;uvres that were about to take
    place, and, the Prince having given his consent to my
    absence, I was appointed to the <i>Theseus</i>, then a comparatively
    new class of cruiser, for the duration of
    these exercises. The new system of mobilisation which
    had recently come in, consisted in the necessary officers
    and crews being marched bodily on board the ship,
    which, up to that time, was lying at a home port with
    nobody on board but the Chief Engineer, the Warrant
    Officers, a few stokers, and a small number of marines,
    who were employed as caretakers. The scheme must
    have been extremely well worked out, as can be shown
    by what actually took place in practice.</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock I and the rest of the newly appointed
    officers went on board; the men were marched on
    board from the barracks or receiving ship, with their
    bags and hammocks. Provisions were at once drawn,
    and by noon the entire ship&rsquo;s company had been
    stationed as regards Fire, Action, Boats and Watches,
    and had been piped to dinner. Chatham was the
    parent port of the <i>Theseus</i>, and before nightfall, the
    Captain having arrived on board during the day, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span> ship had been unberthed and moved into the river, all
    ready to receive her ammunition the next day. By the
    following evening we were anchored at the Nore and
    reported ready for service. It is true that a ship
    commissioned in this way could not really compare in
    efficiency with one that had been on service for some
    time, but every day saw an improvement in general
    smartness and discipline, and in a week&rsquo;s time a
    mobilised ship could, if necessary, have fought a very
    respectable action.</p>
<p>It was now some nine years since I had served in
    a real man-of-war at sea, and I remember being greatly
    impressed with the great improvement that had taken
    place in the acquirements of the officers and men
    during that period. The Captain, Charles Campbell,
    was an old friend, he having been Flag-Lieutenant to
    his relative, Rear-Admiral F. Campbell, in the old
    flying-squadron days; but, barring the Captain, the
    rest of the officers were absolute strangers to me, as,
    indeed, I was to them. I, however, found them to
    be, without exception, thoroughly competent, and one
    and all gave the same loyal and devoted service to
    me, that they could have given to a superior officer
    whom they had known and served under for years.
    Before joining up with the rest of the Fleet for
    man&#339;uvring purposes the <i>Theseus</i> was ordered to
    escort a small squadron of torpedo-boats that had
    been ordered to Gibraltar. These boats were towed
    in turn, as they were unable to keep the sea under
    their own steam for more than a few hours. We
    had a good deal of bad weather on our way out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> which necessitated our going into Vigo, and incidentally
    a good deal of trouble with our small craft;
    but eventually we delivered them safely at their destination,
    and rejoined the Fleet for a month&rsquo;s exercise.</p>
<p>The man&#339;uvres having come to an end, the <i>Theseus</i>, after being inspected by the Admiralty, was
    paid off into the First Class Reserve again, and so
    ended my last term of service afloat. Having left
    the <i>Britannia</i> at the end of 1870, I had served at
    sea, on and off, for some twenty-five years, and
    before taking leave of the Navy, so far as these
    Reminiscences are concerned, I must write a few
    lines about the state it was in in those days.</p>
<p>My service was performed during a period of
    comparative slackness, if such a term can ever be
    applied to the Royal Navy. The fact is, it was a
    time of profound peace. Since 1815 the Navy had
    seen no active service on a large scale. In the middle
    period of the nineteenth century there had been good
    work to do in the suppression of piracy and the slave
    trade. There had been bombardments, such as those
    of Acre, Algiers, Sveaborg, Sevastopol, Cronstadt and
    Alexandria,&mdash;more or less futile, as all bombardments of
    land forts by ships must be. There had even been a
    Naval action at Navarino. Small numbers of men had
    been landed as Naval Brigades all over the world in all
    the great and small wars that we waged in places as far
    apart as the Crimea, India and New Zealand. Later
    on there had been a small modicum of active service
    to be seen by a fortunate few in Egypt, and in South
    Africa during the Zulu campaign. At the time of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> South African War in 1889, there were again small
    Naval Brigades landed, and when there was a danger
    of European complications, in view of the number of
    troops that we had to send to Africa, the sea route
    was efficiently, if very quietly, patrolled. The fact
    was that during the greater part of the time that I was
    serving there was no great competition possible. The
    German Navy hardly existed. For some years after
    1870, the French Navy had been allowed to decrease.
    The Russians only used to build spasmodically. It
    was only shortly before 1890 that the Admiralty had
    seriously to consider their building programme against
    the possible combination of the French and Russian
    Navies, which was then a formidable possibility: and
    it was owing to that possibility mainly that the great
    improvement in general efficiency that I noticed when
    I joined the <i>Theseus</i> had taken place. From that time
    onwards the Navy has never looked back. Successive
    Governments may not have supplied it with anything
    approaching the necessary ships and stores, but the
    senior officers of the Navy have trained the officers
    and men under them, and brought them to that high
    state of efficiency and discipline which has been so
    apparent to the whole world during the war which
    has just come to a conclusion; and that same efficiency
    and devotion to duty has,&mdash;I think as an old
    sailor,&mdash;been handsomely acknowledged, not only by
    the country at large, but by those who are privileged
    to speak for their country, from the Sovereign downwards.
    Personally, I am full of pride at having, at
    one time, had the honour to belong to that noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span> Service, and of having served with what is, perhaps,
    the best corps of officers, with the best lot of men
    under them, in the world.</p>
<p>In my experience, the only time when Naval Officers
    are ever likely to fail is when they are working at the
    Admiralty. The fact is that constant service at sea
    is apt to narrow their outlook from a most important
    point of view,&mdash;I mean that of a man of the world.
    Brought up in a profession where a rigid discipline
    has to be, and is, maintained, they are too apt to be
    rather obsessed by the First Lords of the Admiralty,
    and the other functionaries with whom they are
    brought into contact, and are inclined to treat them
    all with a good deal too much subservience. It is
    rather instinctive for an officer who has served all his
    time at sea to look, with a certain amount of veneration,
    on his superior officers, and consequently to
    be inclined to be overawed by a name that is placed
    in the Navy List as being, after the Sovereign, the
    Head of the Navy. The post of First Lord of the
    Admiralty was always a much coveted one, and on
    the whole it is only just to say that it has been
    generally held by politicians of considerable weight
    and experience. A certain amount of glamour of
    sentiment is supposed to surround it, vividly enhanced
    by the temporary possession of an extremely well-appointed
    yacht, on board of which the female relations
    and friends of the various First Lords could take up
    their abode in the summer, and cruise at their own
    sweet will, at the expense of the long-suffering British
    tax-payer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>
<p>The year 1896 was a very important year&rsquo;s racing
    for those who were interested in the Sandringham
    Stud, for it was in 1896 that the Prince of Wales had
    his first really successful year on the Turf&mdash;that great
    horse Persimmon accounting for the Derby and St.
    Leger and Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket, while
    Thais won the One Thousand Guineas. I saw the
    Derby from what used to be known as the Paget
    Stand, of which institution I was a member for many
    years, and for those who do not know Epsom, it is
    as well to mention that the actual winning-post touches
    the edge of that stand, and the horses are often within
    an arm&rsquo;s length of the &ldquo;Booth&rdquo; (as it used to be
    called), when they passed the post. It is exciting
    enough at any time to see the finish for the Derby
    from that point of vantage, but when, as in 1896,
    there is a desperate race between two really first-class
    horses, as were Persimmon and St. Frusquin, and the
    race is eventually won by the Prince&rsquo;s horse all out
    by a neck, the excitement really becomes indescribable.
    I cannot truthfully say that I have never heard such
    cheering, for I am glad to say that I was to hear it
    again when Minoru won the Derby in 1909. But
    Minoru was, after all, only a leased horse, whereas
    Persimmon was a Sandringham-bred colt, and an own
    brother to Florizel, a winner of good races. Anyhow,
    the enthusiasm of the public knew no bounds, and the
    Prince&rsquo;s Derby achieved the greatest popular success
    that ever was seen on a race-course.</p>
<p>In August of that year I was on duty as usual at
    Cowes, and about the middle of the month I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> ordered to attend the Princess on a journey to the
    Continent. Her Royal Highness, with Miss Charlotte
    Knollys who was Lady in attendance, went to visit her
    brother-in-law and her sister, the Duke and Duchess of
    Cumberland, at their beautiful Castle of Gmunden, which
    is not far from Ischl, and is surrounded by magnificent
    scenery. Personally, never having seen that part of
    Europe before, I was delighted with the beauty of the
    surroundings. After a week&rsquo;s stay there the Princess
    went to Bayreuth, when her party was completed by the
    appearance on the scene of the late Lady Ripon, Miss
    Yznaga (the sister of the Duchess of Manchester) and the
    late Sir Reginald Lister. The <i>Ring</i> was being given as
    usual there, and in some respects very beautifully given;
    but I still think, as I have mentioned before, that the
    artists, as a lot, were very inferior to those I heard
    a few years later at Covent Garden. None the less,
    Bayreuth has a certain atmosphere of its own. Unlike
    London, there are no distractions of any kind in that
    funny little town, so absolutely undivided attention can
    be given to the music. After the Bayreuth week was
    over, I attended the Princess to Copenhagen, visiting <i>en route</i> Nuremberg and the Chiem See, where the
    palace,&mdash;that extraordinary freak imitation of Versailles,
    built by the late King of Bavaria,&mdash;was the objective
    of the visit. After spending one night at Copenhagen, I
    travelled straight through to Wemmergill, where I was
    the guest of a very old friend, Lord Westbury, for a
    week&rsquo;s grouse-driving. Wemmergill, as all shooting
    men know, is one of the very best of the Yorkshire and
    Westmoreland moors, and there, with a very cheery
    shooting party, I had an excellent week&rsquo;s sport.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>
<p>The year 1897 was principally remarkable for the
    Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, and the festivities
    that took place in London in honour of the occasion.
    I had been in waiting in the spring at Cannes, where the
    Prince had, as usual, taken up his residence on board the <i>Britannia</i>, and at all the Riviera Regattas there was good
    sport in matches against <i>Ailsa</i>, but the breezes had ruled
    light, and on the whole the <i>Ailsa</i> had rather the best of
    the numerous contests. It was <i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> last year of
    racing. It was considered not worth while to compete
    against the much newer <i>Meteor</i>, so the old boat took no
    part in the English Regattas, except at Cowes, when,
    starting three times, she won two races, one of which
    was a match round the Isle of Wight for the German
    Emperor&rsquo;s Challenge Shield, in which contest she
    defeated Mr. C. D. Rose&rsquo;s <i>Aurora</i>. Her wonderfully
    successful racing career being thus terminated, she
    became permanently relegated into the cruiser or
    handicap class, and was used for many years by her
    owner for sailing about in the Solent with reduced
    canvas and a very much reduced crew. The Jubilee
    year was another good year for the Sandringham
    horses, as Persimmon won the Ascot Gold Cup in a
    canter, and the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown. Moreover,
    two useful two-year-olds, Little Dorrit and
    Mousme, won a couple of nice races each. &rsquo;97 ended
    Persimmon&rsquo;s career as a race-horse; he probably was at
    his very best when he won the Ascot Cup, and he retired
    to a palatial loose box at Sandringham, where he became
    the sire of over a hundred winners.</p>
<p>One of the marked features of the Diamond Jubilee
    Season in London was the Fancy Dress Ball given at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> Devonshire House. All London Society was there,
    headed by the Prince and Princess of Wales, and it
    certainly was a very beautiful sight. Devonshire House
    lends itself extraordinarily well to a great entertainment,
    for the reception rooms are very fine, another
    feature being the marble staircase; so low are the
    steps and so gradual the ascent, that it really is more
    like an inclined plane than a staircase. It was an
    extraordinarily pretty spectacle for any one standing on
    the big landing of the first floor, to see the endless string
    of guests, in their various costumes, proceeding up
    to be received by their hostess and host at the top of
    the stairs. A great many of the dresses were very
    beautiful, and a record of them still exists, for a number
    of the Duchess&rsquo; friends presented her with an album
    containing as many reproductions as could be collected
    of the photographs and sketches that were taken of the
    various guests in their costumes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later in the year, after Cowes, the Prince and Princess
    decided to go to Bayreuth, and I was in attendance
    during the visit; but one visit to Bayreuth is very like
    another, and as far as I was concerned the only novelty
    was that <i>Parsifal</i> was given as well as the <i>Ring</i>.
    In those days <i>Parsifal</i> never was given except at
    Bayreuth, but that particular portion of the Wagner
    Legend has died out, and since then it has been
    performed both in London and New York. It was the
    fashion to rave about that opera, but I fancy now that
    it is no longer sacred to Bayreuth; the public in general
    have discovered that, fine as it is, the <i>Ring</i> and <i>Tristan</i> are a very great deal finer. So long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span> <i>Parsifal</i> could only be given at Bayreuth it was a
    great attraction to the musical public, and brought a
    number of people there, who, but for it, would probably
    not have taken that troublesome journey. This large
    influx of visitors of course meant money, a commodity
    the value of which was thoroughly understood and
    appreciated by &ldquo;Frau Cosima,&rdquo; for there was a good deal
    of the successful &ldquo;Barnum&rdquo; about that remarkable old
    lady, now deceased. After the Bayreuth week, the
    Princess went on to Copenhagen, and I attended the
    Prince to Kronberg to enable him to pay a visit to his
    sister, the late Empress Frederick. The Empress had
    certainly succeeded in building herself one of the finest
    modern residences I ever saw, and Kronberg was full
    of the beautiful things that she had collected, all
    moreover arranged in excellent taste. After a short
    visit, the Prince went to Homburg, and I returned
    to England in time for Doncaster Races.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>
<h3>ON THE HEADQUARTER STAFF IN SOUTH AFRICA</h3>
<p>Early in 1899 I travelled with the late Lord
    Clarendon, who was at that time Lord Chamberlain, to
    Coburg, to represent the Prince of Wales at the Silver
    Wedding of his brother, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha,
    Lord Clarendon having been selected by Queen
    Victoria for a similar purpose. We spent about a
    week there, at the Castle, while the fêtes connected with
    that anniversary were in progress. It was a great
    pleasure to me to have this opportunity of seeing their
    Royal Highnesses, who had been so kind to me when
    on the Mediterranean Station, and talk over our
    mutual recollections of the numerous cruises of the old <i>Surprise</i>. The night we arrived we were both invited
    to dine with the Royal Family, and extremely pleasant
    it was; but for the rest of the time there were endless
    Court functions and banquets, and I found living in a
    small German Court, cheek by jowl with the German
    Court officials, one of the most disagreeable experiences
    that I can recollect. However, by pleading
    that I had acquaintances in the town,&mdash;which was not
    strictly true,&mdash;I managed to escape from most of the
    dreary household luncheons, finding it infinitely
    preferable to eat by myself at the extremely moderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span> hotel that was all the town of Coburg could boast of
    in the shape of a restaurant. Under these circumstances,
    it was eminently true that the &ldquo;dinner of
    herbs&rdquo; at that very bad inn was better than the &ldquo;stalled
    ox&rdquo; at the Schloss.</p>
<p>But soon more interesting events were to take place,
    for before the end of the year the South African War
    had begun. After what was known then as the &ldquo;black
    week,&rdquo; when, in the course of a few days, the British
    public received news of three very distinct reverses, I
    came to the conclusion that it was impossible for a man
    of my age to remain in England if by hook or by
    crook he could possibly manage to get out to Africa.
    The only plan I could think of was to try to get there
    on the Staff, as Naval Aide-de-Camp, on the plea that
    there was a considerable Naval Brigade being formed to
    work a battery of 4·7 guns to emulate what had already
    been achieved by their comrades in Natal. I applied
    to the Prince for aid, and, as usual, not in vain, for,
    when Field-Marshal Lord Roberts was appointed to be
    Commander-in-Chief in South Africa, through His
    Royal Highness&rsquo; kind offices the Field-Marshal allowed
    me to be appointed as Naval Aide-de-Camp on the
    Headquarter Staff. As it turned out, my duties
    consisted in doing pretty much the same work as the
    other Aides-de-Camp, the bulk of which was deciphering
    and enciphering telegrams; for though when on
    the march I kept as much in touch with what was called
    the &ldquo;Cow-Gun Brigade&rdquo; (the name being, of course,
    derived from the team of eighteen bullocks that dragged
    the guns along), I never could discover that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span> in want of anything except ammunition, the fact being,
    I suppose, that if any particular article was lacking
    they immediately proceeded to try to annex it,
    and in general they succeeded, much to the delight
    of the Quarter-Master-General, who told me that
    they formed the only unit that never gave him any
    trouble.</p>
<p>Apropos of the &ldquo;black week,&rdquo; long after I had
    returned from South Africa, one of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s
    gentlemen told me an interesting story on the subject.
    When the bad news arrived, Queen Victoria,&mdash;though
    she had much too fine, and well-trained a sense of
    proportion to feel in the least nervous,&mdash;thought that
    nevertheless she would like to consult some Military
    Authority who had a knowledge of South Africa.
    Accordingly, the late Sir Evelyn Wood was summoned
    to Balmoral. When he presented himself he was
    addressed somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Evelyn, I have sent for you to consult you
    about the campaign in South Africa, but, mind, I will
    have no croakers here.&rdquo; I have always thought that
    there was something deliciously Elizabethan about this
    prefatory remark. All this is, I fear, a digression; but
    to revert to the end of 1899,&mdash;the main point for me
    was to get out to South Africa somehow, and that I
    succeeded in doing.</p>
<p>Lord Roberts sailed with his Staff on board the mail
    steamer just before Christmas, calling at Gibraltar on
    the 26th of December to pick up Lord Kitchener, who
    had been brought there direct from Egypt in a cruiser.
    He duly arrived on board on that date, accompanied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span> his two Aides-de-Camp, Lieutenant Walter Cowan,
    R.N., and Captain James Watson. Cowan is now
    Rear-Admiral Sir Walter, having done excellent work
    during the late war, and indeed after it, in the Baltic,
    while Jimmy Watson has made a career for himself in
    Egypt, where, amongst other things, he was on the
    personal Staff of the late Khedive, and I fancy still
    rejoices in the rank of Watson Pasha. Both of these
    best of good fellows became friends of mine, and I am
    glad to say we still occasionally meet.</p>
<p>Next to my Chief and Lord Kitchener, the man who
    gave me the greatest impression of outstanding ability
    was the late Colonel Henderson. He was, I think,
    appointed to the Commander-in-Chief&rsquo;s Staff as Head
    Intelligence Officer, and a better appointment never was
    made. He was a really scientific soldier in the fullest
    sense of the word; as a literary man he had written
    one of the very best military books ever printed in
    his <i>Life of Stonewall Jackson</i>; as a lecturer at the Staff
    College he had delivered some most interesting and
    instructive lectures on military subjects,&mdash;indeed so
    clear and well-written were they that, when published,
    even a sailor like myself could understand and appreciate
    them. Moreover, he was a most charming companion,
    and always ready (if asked) to give others the
    benefit of his great erudition. Unfortunately, even
    then his health was failing. So ill was he that in a
    very short time he had to give up riding and take to a
    Cape cart, and, sad to relate, before the campaign was
    ended he had been invalided home to England, and
    died a year or two after his return. He was very kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span> to me, and,&mdash;perhaps because he was a great admirer of
    my brother John&rsquo;s <i>History of the Army</i>,&mdash;he often gave
    me of his best in conversation. It used to be my
    delight on board the steamer to get hold of him after
    dinner and induce him to talk.</p>
<p>There was a considerable sprinkling of Germans and
    Dutchmen among the passengers, most of whom were
    probably spies; but any designs they might have entertained
    of making some sort of raid on the Chief&rsquo;s day-cabin
    in the hopes of getting hold of his papers, was
    frustrated by the fact that we had a gunboat&rsquo;s crew on
    board, going out to relieve men whose time had
    expired on some small craft on the South African
    Station. These men were at once made use of as
    sentries, and so we were able to post a permanent
    sentry on Lord Roberts&rsquo; cabin door, as well as permanent
    orderlies, to be at his beck and call.</p>
<p>The voyage out was quite uneventful, and our
    steamer duly arrived at Cape Town on January 10th.
    The Commander-in-Chief took up his quarters in a
    very decent little house that had been reserved for
    him, and I personally settled down close by at the
    Mount Nelson Hotel. There was not much for the
    Aides-de-Camp to do while there, for the real work of
    the Headquarter Staff was the preparation for the
    advance to Bloemfontein, the entire transport service
    being reorganised and increased by Lord Kitchener.
    A few days after our arrival I was sent down to Simon&rsquo;s
    Bay to inquire into some complaints that had been
    lodged by the Boer prisoners who were confined on
    board a transport that was anchored there. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span> complaints were absolutely frivolous and hardly worth
    inquiring into, but were rather amusing as giving an
    insight into the character of that curious creature whom
    the British Tommy invariably talked of as &ldquo;Brother
    Boer.&rdquo; Their principal grievance was that they were
    overcrowded. On inquiry I found out that the transport
    in question had brought 1200 British troops from
    England, and whenever it was the least rough all the
    lower main-deck ports had to be closed, and naturally the
    ship was under a full head of steam all the time she
    was making her passage through the tropics. Probably
    under those conditions the heat and want of air was
    very trying, but war is war, and discomforts must be
    expected. The Boer prisoners on board numbered only
    440; every sort of ventilation could be freely opened
    while the ship swung round her anchors, and of course
    no steam was up. So I explained to the Boer officer
    who was the spokesman that what was good enough for
    1200 British troops at sea was luxury for a handful of
    prisoners in harbour. He was a decent fellow, and
    agreed with me that there was no real cause for complaint,
    but went on to say that Boers were accustomed
    to the freedom of the veldt and felt the confinement
    very keenly. It then devolved on me to explain that
    our prisoners at Pretoria, living behind barbed wire,
    were also, not exactly, having the time of their lives.
    This seemed to come quite as a revelation to him, and
    of course I reported that they had nothing whatever to
    complain of, and the matter dropped.</p>
<p>I had one or two more trips over to Simon&rsquo;s Bay to
    report on the 4·7 guns that were being fitted out there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span> as a battery of mobile siege guns, to be used in the
    field, and manned by the Naval Brigade.</p>
<p>Another little suburban trip I made was to Stellenbosch.
    (The name later became, used as a verb, a
    polite form of speech for denoting the fact that some
    unfortunate official had proved incompetent, and had to
    be got rid of.) When I went there it boasted of a
    large remount establishment, the animals being mostly
    Argentine cobs and Cape ponies. I succeeded in getting
    hold of two very useful ones, the Cape pony in
    particular turning out to be a treasure. I had accompanied
    Lord Kitchener and some of his Staff, who were,
    I expect, inspecting the establishment from the point of
    view of transport.</p>
<p>Altogether we were just about two months at Cape
    Town, and very weary we all were of the place and
    right glad when the orders came at last to go to the
    front! The pleasantest incidents in the life there was
    the constant meeting of all sorts of old friends, who
    generally turned up for dinner at Groote-Schurr, which,
    at that time, had been lent by Mr. Cecil Rhodes to
    Lady Edward Cecil and Lady Charles Bentinck, who
    were very busy at war work in the town close at hand.
    Then every day fresh arrivals turned up from England;
    my cousin, Lady Bagot, (then Mrs. Joycelyn Bagot), and
    Lady Henry Bentinck had come out to look after the
    Portland Hospital; the present Lord Derby, then Lord
    Stanley, arrived on the scene as Press Censor,&mdash;and all
    one&rsquo;s friends that came down from the front, either
    wounded or for a few days&rsquo; leave, generally turned
    up at Groote-Schurr, where open house was kept by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span> Cecil Rhodes for his temporary tenants and their
    friends.</p>
<p>The only other work we Aides-de-Camp had was to
    cipher and decipher the telegrams that poured in all day,
    which were not finally disposed of until nearly midnight,
    and two of us were generally on duty with the Chief
    when he was inspecting or going for a constitutional
    ride in the cool of the evening.</p>
<p>But on the 6th of February our stay at Cape Town
    came to an end, and the Headquarter Staff left by train
    for the Modder, and then events succeeded each other
    pretty quickly. On the 11th Lord Roberts&rsquo; flank
    march began. As concerned the Headquarter Staff, we
    moved first to Ramdam, and by the 15th were at
    Jacobsdaal, where we received the good news that
    French had relieved Kimberley. On the 17th, Cronje
    was held up at Paardeberg, and on the 19th Lord
    Roberts and his Staff arrived there.</p>
<p>I am not going into details about the action at
    Paardeberg. After what we have experienced lately,
    I suppose no soldier, nowadays, would do otherwise
    than agree that it would have been worth while, even
    at the expense of a considerable quantity of casualties,
    to have bundled Cronje out of his laager without further
    delay. Even if a good many men might have been
    sacrificed in such an assault, they would have been few
    compared to those who perished later of the germs
    of typhoid probably picked up during that ten days&rsquo;
    wait at Paardeberg. The river being full of dead
    animals, the water the men were drinking was poisonous.
    Now, the British soldier is a thirsty animal (and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span> indeed, as far as the infantryman is concerned, he has
    every right to be, when, as in Africa, he was carrying
    a heavy kit under a burning sun and enveloped in
    clouds of dust). The result was that the men were,
    more than probably, absorbing typhoid germs during
    the whole of their stay there.</p>
<p>When the Headquarter Staff arrived there on the
    19th there were rumours of an immediate surrender.
    There must have been further parleys of which I knew
    nothing, for a few days later I was sent under a white
    flag to the Boers&rsquo; laager with a letter addressed to the
    Boer Commandant. After I had crossed the drift held
    by the Boers, I was received by them with perfect
    civility, and duly delivered my letter, to which, apparently,
    there was no answer, as I did not bring one
    back, but I remember well the difficulty I had in getting
    my horse to cross and recross, so piled up was the river
    at this fording-place with dead and putrefying animals.
    A very few days later, on February 27th, I was riding
    in the same direction again, this time to accompany one
    of the Generals on the Headquarter Staff, Prettyman
    by name, who was sent out by the Chief to bring
    Cronje in. I suppose it was on the strength of this
    casual acquaintance that Cronje, after his surrender,
    very much to my disgust, elected to annex my own
    particular shelter in the Camp, for the use of himself and
    his old wife, who was the living image of the late Dan
    Leno when made up for the Christmas pantomime; but
    it was only for a short time, as he and his 4000 fellow-prisoners
    were sent down to the Cape next day, most
    of them <i>en route</i> for St. Helena.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>
<p>The next day we had the news of the relief of Ladysmith,
    on the anniversary of our defeat at Majuba Hill,
    with all the disgraceful memories of the peace that had
    been patched up after it. Now at last the disgrace had
    been wiped out. Well might the Boers say that, after
    Paardeberg and Ladysmith, we had robbed them even
    of their Majuba Day.</p>
<p>We were soon on the move after Cronje&rsquo;s surrender,
    and by the 12th of March had occupied Bloemfontein.
    We met with but few difficulties on the road, the only
    serious trouble being to keep supplies going, and ensure
    a sufficiency of water. There was one not inconsiderable
    action on the way, which was fought at Dreifontein,
    and I was lucky enough to see rather more of it than
    usual. I had been sent on to select some quarters for
    the Chief, if there happened to be any available, and
    had succeeded in finding quite a decent farm, for the
    moment occupied by our wounded, which would answer
    the purpose; so my job being completed, and the rest
    of the Headquarter Staff being many hours behind, I
    went on with some of my friends among the special
    correspondents to watch the fighting. I remember that
    Mr. Gwynne (then, I think, the special correspondent
    of Reuter, now the well-known editor of the <i>Morning
    Post</i>) and I settled ourselves down on the top of a very
    comfortable little kopje, at a convenient distance on
    the flank of our advance, and watched some of the infantry
    of the Sixth Division take the Boer position. The
    Boers were holding a line of kopjes within easy view
    from where we were ensconced, and were keeping up a
    hot fire on our advancing troops&mdash;who were attacking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span> in the most orthodox way in short rushes, and making
    use of all the cover available. When our troops had
    fought their way close up to the Boer line we distinctly
    saw a Boer show himself on the sky-line with his arms
    up in an obvious attitude of surrender. The attacking
    force, thinking that it was all over, at once showed
    themselves, and were received by a heavy volley at
    close range, which killed and wounded a number of
    them; the rest, without a pause, rushed on, and in a
    few minutes the position was captured. As always,
    the British soldier showed the greatest magnanimity,
    and instead of bayoneting the Boers, as they had a
    perfect right to do for what certainly appeared to be a
    distinct act of treachery, they contented themselves
    with making prisoners of all those who had not succeeded
    in bolting off on their ponies. The little action
    at Dreifontein was a very considerable success, and
    might have been an important one, were it not that, as
    usual, the underfed and overworked cavalry horses were
    so exhausted that a pursuit was rendered impossible.</p>
<p>Two days later, on March 13th, Lord Roberts entered
    Bloemfontein. During the early morning of that
    day I had been sent forward to see if I could find some
    halting-place where the Headquarter Staff could breakfast,
    and was fortunate enough to find a very comfortable
    farm for that purpose, which, as it turned out, belonged
    to a brother-in-law of Steyn&rsquo;s. The lady of the house,
    who was quite a nice woman, received us very amiably,
    but told us that the Boers never expected we should
    have left the river and marched in the way we did, as
    they were persuaded that the route we took would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span> result in the army inevitably perishing of thirst,
    so waterless was that bit of country. I expect the
    margin was narrow, but events justified the selection
    made, and all was well. Just as the Headquarter Staff
    rode into the town, a column arrived, so Lord Roberts
    and his Staff halted and pulled out of the way to
    allow the Grenadier Guards to march in. It was a
    magnificent sight. The men, after a terrific march,
    caked with dust, parched with thirst, and literally in
    rags, swung past their Chief with their heads erect, and
    all the air of conquerors. For the moment all fatigue
    seemed to have left them, and they marched as if they
    were returning to their barracks after an hour&rsquo;s exercise
    in Hyde Park.</p>
<p>Bloemfontein for the first week or so was quite a
    pleasant change after about six weeks on the march
    through a very thirsty country. We began by being
    billeted in the sort of Government House usually occupied
    by Steyn and his family. It was quite a good and
    well-built house, and four of us occupied a large room
    on the second floor, which we believed to be Mrs.
    Steyn&rsquo;s bedroom. I remember we came to the conclusion
    that the lady in question must have been
    somewhat primitive in her toilet arrangements, for
    nothing in the shape of washing utensils were to be
    seen; such a thing as a bath, for instance, was obviously
    non-existent, and indeed there was not even a water-tap
    above the ground floor. However, my room-mates
    and myself, who all happened to be old friends, settled
    down very comfortably. They were Lord Dudley and
    his brother, Jack Ward (the present Sir John Ward), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span> Lord Stanley, who was still doing duty as Press Censor.
    A short time afterwards, when Colonel Neville Chamberlain
    gave up his post as Private Secretary to the
    Commander-in-Chief, Stanley succeeded him, and later
    accompanied the Chief home. I was unlucky enough to
    have taken rather a bad chill after a very soaking night
    at Paardeberg, and though I managed to stick it out until
    our arrival at Bloemfontein, I had to lay up for a few
    days with a good deal of fever, so being the invalid of
    the party I was allotted the only bed, the rest of my
    comrades sleeping more or less on the floor. There
    being nothing particular to do for the moment, the
    doctor thought I might just as well get a little change
    and rest, so as soon as I had got rid of my little
    feverish attack I went down to Cape Town for a week,
    partly for change of air, and principally to buy stores
    for the Headquarter Mess. The railway was running
    through to the Cape all right, the only trouble being
    that the Boers had blown up the big railway bridge at
    Norval&rsquo;s Pont, so on my way down I had to cross the
    river in a boat.</p>
<p>Nothing in South Africa impressed me so greatly as
    the efficiency of the Railway Corps. I crossed the
    Orange River three times in three months, the first
    time, as above mentioned, in a boat, the second time,
    a week later, in a train over a temporary bridge, and
    three months afterwards in a train running over the
    permanent bridge that is there to this day. During the
    whole of the advance to Pretoria, when marching along
    the line, the Railway Engineers succeeded in keeping
    pace with the Army on the march, bringing up not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span> only their repairing plant, but stores for the Army as
    well. Though we, who were riding close to the railway
    line, could see all the rails standing on-end, twisted
    like corkscrews for miles ahead of us, and though the
    ponts which crossed the innumerable spruits were one
    and all blown up, the trains succeeded in keeping up
    with the troops; and even the bridge over the Valsch
    River at Kroonstadt, which is a real river, only delayed
    them for a few days. In fact, the ordinary wreckage
    of war is repaired almost as quickly as it is created.</p>
<p>I spent a pleasant week at Groote-Schurr. Cecil
    Rhodes had returned there after the relief of Kimberley;
    his brother Frankie, still looking very thin after
    the privations of the Ladysmith siege, was taking a
    brief holiday in his brother&rsquo;s house. Alas! he also
    is no longer with us. He was one of my oldest
    friends, for I had known him since my young days,
    when hunting from Grantham. He was the kindest
    of men, and those of the beleaguered garrison of Ladysmith,
    who knew him during the siege, were always
    full of stories of his generosity and unselfishness. Ian
    Hamilton, now General Sir Ian, was another Ladysmith
    man who came there for a few days&rsquo; fattening-up,
    Billy Lambton, then a Captain in the Coldstream Guards
    (now General Sir William), was also a guest, during his
    recovery from a severe shell-wound in the knee received
    at Magersfontein; whilst the two ladies&mdash;Lady
    Edward Cecil and Lady Charles Bentinck&mdash;were still
    doing their work at Cape Town, with Groote-Schurr
    for their headquarters.</p>
<p>When my week&rsquo;s leave had expired, four of us took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span> the train back to Bloemfontein, but I may as well
    quote an old letter I wrote home at the time to describe
    my journey.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;We started up a party of four, the two Groote-Schurr
        ladies, Artie Stanley, and myself. We had two very comfortable
        carriages, one for the ladies and one for the men, and no
        end of provisions and champagne provided for us by our kind
        host. It was all very cheery as far as Norval&rsquo;s Pont, where the
        railway authorities succeeded in getting our train bodily over
        the temporary bridge that spanned the Orange River. At
        Norval&rsquo;s Pont they had just had the news of Broadwood&rsquo;s
        disaster at Sanna&rsquo;s Post, and the funks had rather set in on the
        line. Admiral Maxse had telegraphed to his daughter (Lady
        Edward Cecil) forbidding her to come up any further, and
        Artie Stanley also received a telegram telling him that no
        civilians were to go on, so all my pleasant companions were
        bundled out of the train and their places taken by various
        officers. After a very long delay we got off, and in the middle
        of the night, at one of the stations, we were all wakened up
        and ordered to have rifles ready, for the Boers were said to be
        on the line somewhere. However, it turned out to be only
        a scare, and as I did not possess a rifle it did not concern me,
        and eventually in due course, without any further disturbance,
        the train arrived here. Next day all was peace again, so telegrams
        were sent to the ladies to say that they might come
        up, which they promptly did. The day after the panic season
        set in again, and they were packed off back again to the base.
        When I got back I found that all the Staff, except the Chief&rsquo;s
        own particular little lot, had been shot out of Government
        House, so, greatly to our comfort, Eddy Stanley, Dudley,
        Bend d&rsquo;Or (the Duke of Westminster) and I, find ourselves
        lodged on the ground floor of a very decent house belonging to
        one Fischer, a prominent Boer statesman, who has bolted.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next fortnight at Bloemfontein was very dull
    and uneventful, and, moreover, rather depressing with
    the knowledge, that hard work and bad water were,
    between them, responsible for about 1500 enteric cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span> in the Bloemfontein hospitals. The daily round was
    monotonous enough. At seven every morning I was
    in the saddle, and generally went round to see the
    Naval Brigade, who had made themselves and their
    cow-guns extremely comfortable at the top of a neighbouring
    kopje, but as they never were in need of
    anything, my visits were of the perfunctory order.
    Later in the day, I took my turn with the other Aides-de-Camp
    to ride in attendance on the Chief, and work
    away at the usual deciphering and enciphering business.
    But our little home, thanks to the fact that one of its
    leading inhabitants, Lord Stanley, was Press Censor,
    was, I verily believe, the &ldquo;hub&rdquo; of Bloemfontein.
    Thither all the Press correspondents, some eighty in
    number and locally known as &ldquo;Stanley&rsquo;s Light Horse,&rdquo;
    used to repair to get their perpetual messages censored,
    and (low be it spoken!) when news was scanty, as it
    very often was during the long halt at Bloemfontein,
    to try and pick up a few crumbs from us. Between
    us, we generally could produce the latest camp stories,
    and when there was nothing better, those very unveracious
    statements had to serve. The &ldquo;Specials&rdquo;
    had amongst their ranks a number of very clever
    people, to say nothing of at least one very distinguished
    man in the person of Mr. Rudyard Kipling, whose
    acquaintance I made then for the first time. Amongst
    the veterans were Mr. Bennett Burleigh and Mr.
    Melton Prior, both old acquaintances of mine, whose
    names had been known for years all over the Empire,
    whilst amongst the younger men were Messrs. Gwynne,
    Perceval Landon, and Prevost Battersby,&mdash;the latter I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> had got to know well on the voyage out, we having
    been fellow-passengers in the same steamer.</p>
<p>It very soon was deemed necessary to start a newspaper,
    and the <i>Friend</i> was produced to supply the
    want, under the auspices of Rudyard Kipling, Perceval
    Landon, and Gwynne,&mdash;a veritable galaxy of talent. It
    was only the other day that Mr. Kipling and I were
    talking over old Bloemfontein days, and he gave me
    a delightful account of how he and his coadjutors,
    having a good deal of space at their disposal, filled it
    up with advertisements stating that certain little shops
    in the town could provide every sort of luxury. Most
    of these said luxuries were purely imaginary and
    probably have not even penetrated to Bloemfontein to
    this day, and he went on to describe the rage of the
    crowds of customers who had at once swarmed into the
    town thinking to do their shopping!</p>
<p>Towards the end of April, Dudley and I got a few
    days&rsquo; leave from our Chief to accompany a flying
    column that was going to Taban-Tchu under the
    command of Ian Hamilton. We loaded up a Cape
    cart with provisions and once more started on the trek.
    And a delightful change it was to be on the veldt
    again after living for so long in that rather poisonous
    little town! The objective of the expedition was, I
    believe, that of a rounding-up movement designed to
    surround the Boer forces, who were said to be moving
    to the northward somewhere in that neighbourhood.
    Unfortunately, the Boers were too quick for us, and
    there was no apparent result, and with the exception
    of some desultory skirmishing on the outskirts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> Taban-Tchu and Israel Port, the column to which we
    had attached ourselves had but little fighting to do.
    Viewed as a pleasure trip it was very agreeable, as the
    climate was perfection and, to us, it was all new country.</p>
<p>By the end of the week I was back at Bloemfontein
    again, but this time only for a very few days, as the
    long, weary period of waiting there had come to an
    end, and on May 3rd Lord Roberts, with the Headquarter
    Staff, went by train to Karri Siding, to assume
    direct command of the Army that was now on the
    march to Pretoria. It is not my intention to describe
    Lord Roberts&rsquo; march to Pretoria, except from the point
    of view of a spectator. Very little fighting took place,
    but it struck me that the Boers were distinctly clever.
    They wasted a great many days for us by repeatedly
    putting up a show that was just big enough to force
    our invading army to deploy, and the loss of time
    involved made a very considerable hole in the short
    winter days of May and June.</p>
<p>By the 12th of May Kroonstadt had been occupied;
    the Boers had, of course, destroyed the railway bridge
    that crosses the Valsch River, and it took our railway
    engineers the best part of a week to span that very
    fair-sized stream with a temporary bridge that could
    carry the train. By the 22nd we were on the move
    again to the northward, and on the 27th the Main
    Army crossed the Vaal River at Vereeniging, and the
    invasion of the Transvaal had definitely begun. On
    the 31st May Johannesburg was captured. I am again
    quoting from a letter which I wrote home at the
    time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;It was rather fun riding into Johannesburg, but really
        anything like the villainous faces of the crowd I have never
        seen. All the Boers, and most of the Dutch and English, had
        either cleared out or been cleared out. There was nothing
        left but a mob of low-class foreign Jews, most of them
        Germans. Never have I seen such brutes, and my first feeling
        was one of intense regret that the Boers had not exploded the
        mines and blown up the entire population at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little less than a week later (June 5th, 1900)
    Pretoria was reached and was entered by the Commander-in-Chief
    after a very trifling opposition. The
    central column, with which the Headquarter Staff
    moved, had done the 300 miles&mdash;that is the distance
    from Bloemfontein to Pretoria&mdash;in thirty-four days,
    which was good going. The flank columns had even
    a harder time. Ian Hamilton started three days earlier
    from Taban-Tchu with his column, and marched 380
    miles, having only had eight days&rsquo; halt during the
    whole thirty-seven days. The night we arrived at
    Pretoria a most amusing dinner was organised by
    Lord Rosslyn to celebrate the occasion, and I suppose
    also to commemorate his personal release from captivity,
    for he had been for some time a prisoner of war
    at Pretoria. It was immense fun, every one being in
    the highest spirits. The dinner took place at the hotel,
    and the company consisted more or less of junior
    officers from every branch of the Service, released
    prisoners, and a number of special correspondents; and
    I, having managed to commandeer a bedroom on the
    premises, did my dinner party very comfortably.</p>
<p>Life on the Headquarter Staff at Pretoria was very
    much on the model of Bloemfontein, with even more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span> telegrams to cope with, but the monotony was broken
    by the two days&rsquo; indecisive action at Diamond Hill&mdash;a
    position that Botha had occupied about sixteen miles
    from the capital, which was, so long as there was a
    decent-sized Boer Army there, a distinct menace to
    Pretoria. The action began early on June 11th, and
    fighting went on during that and the ensuing day. It
    was successful in that the Boers retreated and left us
    in possession of their position, but was quite indecisive,
    as there was no pursuit, and for more than a month
    Botha&rsquo;s commandos were giving us trouble in the
    neighbourhood of the battlefield.</p>
<p>Personally, I was a heavy loser in the action of
    Diamond Hill, for my next brother, Lionel, then
    second in command of the 17th Lancers, was shot
    dead by a bullet through the heart when in command
    of a squadron of that regiment. He and a subaltern
    of his, Lieut. Charles Cavendish, a son of the late
    Lord Chesham, and the late Lord Airlie, commanding
    the 9th Lancers, all fell there and were buried together
    on the field.</p>
<p>A few days after the action of Diamond Hill I was
    in attendance on the Chief on rather an interesting
    occasion, namely when he rode out to meet Baden-Powell,
    who arrived at Pretoria just about a month
    after the relief of Mafeking. A few days afterwards
    I went by train to Johannesburg, partly on a shopping
    expedition and partly to see a great friend of mine,
    Bobby White, who was about to start a syndicate there
    to finance the tramways. My travelling companions
    were two of the ladies who had arrived with Baden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>-Powell
    from Mafeking&mdash;Lady Sarah Wilson and Mrs.
    Godley, both of whom had been through the siege
    there and were on their way home to England, whither
    I was, before very long, to follow them.</p>
<p>After two days at Johannesburg I was back again
    at Pretoria; but my time in Pretoria was rapidly
    drawing to an end. The Naval Brigade had left the
    vicinity of Headquarters, so I had no excuse in the
    way of looking after their wants, as they were far out
    of my reach. Life at Pretoria was more dull than
    words can describe, the only duty being the eternal
    ciphering, which I came to the conclusion could be
    done just as well by the numerous subalterns on Lord
    Roberts&rsquo; Staff as by an officer of my standing. I
    consequently decided, as there was nothing to do, that
    I might just as well return to my duties on the Staff
    of the Prince of Wales. Early in July I left Pretoria
    for Cape Town, and arrived in England at the end of
    the month.</p>
<p>Africa had been an interesting experience, especially
    the long marches from the Modder to Pretoria, and
    my time there was, as long as we were on the move,
    really delightful. There is something extraordinarily
    attractive about the high veldt; the air is as exhilarating
    as champagne, and the endless rolling plain without a
    boundary to be seen has a charm which it is not easy to
    describe; and though the sun may be occasionally too
    fierce, and the cold at nights rather too severe after the
    heat, it is none the less a marvellous climate, and,
    barring the want of water, it is an ideal place for
    campaigning. Moreover, the greater part of the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span> I was living with some of my best friends, and, for a
    sailor, it was a new experience to see a large British
    Army doing its job. Besides my old friends, I made
    the acquaintance of many new ones, several of whose
    names have since become household words during the
    late war. To say nothing of such celebrities as Lords
    Roberts and Kitchener, there were Douglas Haig (or
    rather Lord Haig as he is now), General Lord Rawlinson,
    Admiral Sir Walter Cowan, all of whom were
    Staff Officers in those days; and looking over some old
    letters, written out there, I can congratulate myself on
    the prescience which led me to prophesy that the then
    Major Douglas Haig was sure to make a name for
    himself in the future. The only fly in the ointment
    was that, by going abroad, I had missed a very interesting
    treble event, namely Ambush winning the Grand
    National, and Diamond Jubilee securing the Two
    Thousand Guineas and Derby for the Prince; but it
    does not need much philosophy to grasp the fact that a
    man cannot be in two places at once, and good fun as it
    is to back winners, it was far more satisfactory to have
    had the privilege of seeing the most interesting part
    of the South African War from the vantage point of
    the Headquarter Staff.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER  X</a></h2>
<h3>SOME SCOTTISH HOUSES</h3>
<p>I had arrived in England in time for the Cowes
    Season, and was again in waiting in October in attendance
    on the Prince during a short visit he paid to Queen
    Victoria at Balmoral, on his way to Mar Lodge. I had,
    of course, been presented to the Queen before, but on
    this occasion, being an officer just returned from the
    Front, Her Majesty was particularly gracious, giving
    me her hand to kiss, and sending for me after dinner
    for a few minutes&rsquo; conversation. It was the very last
    time that I was ever to see her, for a few months later
    she was laid to her rest at Windsor.</p>
<p>Mar Lodge is a delightful place, about twenty miles
    or so higher up the Deeside than Balmoral, and in
    those days it had only recently taken the place of the
    old Mar Lodge standing the other side of the river.
    The fire that destroyed the old lodge really must have
    been a blessing in disguise for the late Duke of Fife,
    for, (however pleasant its associations may have been,)
    it was badly situated, and its destruction gave him the
    excuse for building the present house, which is certainly
    one of the most comfortable residences in the North
    of Scotland. In those high latitudes it is everything
    to have the house the right side of the river,&mdash;that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> to say on the north side, with the consequent south
    aspect,&mdash;and the new Mar Lodge was ideally situated in
    that respect, fairly near the river, with a lovely view
    from its windows. Beautiful as are the surroundings
    of Balmoral, the castle none the less suffers from being
    on the south side of the Dee; there being considerable
    want of sunshine there in the shorter days of October.</p>
<p>The Prince had some good deer-driving at Mar,
    and another enjoyable amusement provided for the
    guests was a well-laid-out little golf-course. The
    Duke and his family were all keen golfers.</p>
<p>Another Deeside shooting lodge that was occasionally
    visited by the Prince was Glenmuick, which
    stands about half-way between Balmoral and Ballater.
    The existing house was built by the first Baronet, the
    then well-known Mackenzie of Kintail. The present
    baronet is an officer in the Grenadier Guards, a grandson
    of the old laird to whom I am alluding. The
    original Laird of Glenmuick was a great character.
    Starting in life as a small tradesman in Aberdeen, he
    had succeeded in making a large fortune, and became
    a popular person in Society, for he owned a few race-horses,
    was full of Scotch stories, and, moreover, played
    a very good game of whist. Glenmuick was a delightful
    place, for there is not only a good deer forest,
    where I have had some first-rate stalking, but there is
    also a very fair grouse moor. But the house itself
    could hardly be said to be a success. I always believed
    that its situation was selected rather with the view of
    impressing the good people of Ballater with the importance
    of its owner, than to provide a comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span> home for himself and his guests. As far as I could
    see during my stay there, the only room that
    sunshine ever reached was the kitchen. None the
    less, it was a most amusing house to stay in, and
    the all-round sport was excellent.</p>
<p>There is nothing of any importance for me to relate
    until the new year of 1901. On the 20th of January
    Queen Victoria brought her long reign to an end, and
    died at Osborne, and my master came to the throne as
    King Edward VII. I was not in personal attendance
    on him at the time, but there was so much to do that
    his entire Staff was mobilised. Of course, representatives
    from all over the world flocked to London for
    the funeral, and I found myself detailed to look after
    the Russian and Greek suites that had come over in
    attendance on the Grand Duke Michael and the King
    of the Hellenes, the respective representatives of those
    two countries. There was great difficulty in housing
    this enormous influx of guests, but the late Mr.
    Larnach was one of those who came to the assistance of
    the Court Officials, by placing his fine house in Carlton
    House Gardens at their disposal, and I consequently
    took up my abode there, to look after the Russian and
    Greek gentlemen.</p>
<p>On the day of the funeral the party to which I was
    attached met the funeral cortège at Windsor, and I
    was consequently at the station there when a slight
    contretemps happened that attracted a good deal of
    attention at the time. The horses of the Horse
    Artillery team which were harnessed to the gun-carriage
    that was used as a bier, had become restive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span> from their long wait in the cold, and began to plunge
    about to such an extent that the coffin seemed to be in
    danger of being displaced. There was a Guard of
    Honour of bluejackets posted at the station, and
    Prince Louis of Battenberg, who was with them,
    quickly grasped the situation. The horses were taken
    out, the bluejackets manned the traces, and the last
    stage of the late Queen&rsquo;s long journey from Osborne
    to Windsor was done in charge of the Royal Navy, to
    their great pride and satisfaction, and, naturally, to the
    infinite disappointment of the Royal Horse Artillery.</p>
<p>During the year of mourning that followed there
    was not much of interest for me to record; but in the
    late autumn King Edward was in residence for the first
    time as the owner of Balmoral. Naturally, His
    Majesty was not entertaining a party there, so there
    was not much official work to do, consequently on
    most days when there was not a deer drive, Harry
    Stonor, (who was on duty there as Groom-in-Waiting),
    and I, were sent on the hill to stalk, and very fine
    sport we had. I think between us, in something like
    ten days, we had twenty-five stags to our credit.</p>
<p>The year 1902 was a very busy one. In March I
    was in attendance on their Majesties, when they visited
    Dartmouth to lay the foundation-stone of the College
    there that took the place of the old <i>Britannia</i>. The
    change was all for the better, as the old ship was far
    from healthy even in my time, and age was not likely
    to improve her sanitary condition. From Dartmouth
    the Royal party went on to Plymouth, and passed the
    night on board the <i>Victoria and Albert</i>, where a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span> dinner party was entertained, consisting not only of the
    principal Naval Officials belonging to the port, but
    also of the Admiral and Captains of a Japanese Squadron
    that was there at the time. On the following day
    Queen Alexandra launched H.M.S. <i>Queen</i>, with the
    usual ceremonial, and the King laid the first plate of a
    new battleship, the <i>King Edward</i>.</p>
<p>About two months later I was spending a Sunday at
    the White Lodge, Richmond Park, with one of my
    oldest friends, Mrs. Hartmann, to whom the lodge
    had been lent by the King. At luncheon time she
    announced to her guests that the King was motoring
    down for tea, and at tea-time he duly arrived. We
    were all assembled out in the garden, and I was sure
    from his manner that there was some news in store for
    us. We had not long to wait, as without any waste
    of words he informed us that what he was about to tell
    us would be known to the world next morning, and
    that was, that the conditions of peace had been signed
    at Vereeniging, which virtually meant that the long
    and tiresome South African War had come to an end.
    For many years past, even people quite unaddicted to
    business in the City, had been gambling in South
    African shares, much, I suppose, to the delight of the
    South African Jews, who had invaded London and
    taken up their abode there. It seemed the obvious
    thing that, peace being signed, South Africans would go
    up, and I fancy a good many of us went up to London
    early next morning to get the first of the market.
    The obvious rarely happens in real life, and, as far as
    I can remember, the shares that were expected to rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span> all fell, and the small punters, as usual, lost their
    money.</p>
<p>In June the Coronation that had been arranged for
    the 24th was put off, owing to the very serious illness
    of the King, and the operation that it entailed. I was
    in attendance on the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch
    of Russia, who had been sent to represent his
    brother, the Emperor. The Grand Duke was attended
    by a large suite, who were lodged very conveniently for
    the expected ceremony at the Buckingham Palace
    Hotel. Most of us remember the consternation that
    reigned in London when the ceremony was postponed,
    and few could have imagined it possible that the King
    could have made such a marvellous recovery as he did,
    and thus enable the Coronation to take place at the
    early date of August the 9th,&mdash;but so it was.</p>
<p>On the 1st of August I went down to Cowes to
    take my turn of duty. His Majesty had been already
    there for about a fortnight, and I remember my amazed
    delight at seeing him looking so marvellously well after
    such a short convalescence. Sir Frederick Treves,
    who had performed the operation (a very serious one),
    told me how astonished he was at the King&rsquo;s powers of
    recuperation; and then afterwards, on the day after the
    Coronation, he was again telling me that he did not
    think it humanly possible that any man, who had only
    just recovered from such a dangerous illness, could be
    as well as he was after that very long and fatiguing
    ceremony at Westminster. I was very fortunate in
    being in personal attendance on that historic occasion,
    which has been so often described by far more practised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span> pens than mine, that I refrain from enlarging on it;
    but as an instance of their Majesties&rsquo; kind thoughtfulness
    for their attendants, after the cortège had returned
    to the palace we were all given the opportunity of
    offering our congratulations, before the King and Queen
    had divested themselves of their very beautiful, but
    remarkably heavy, coronation robes.</p>
<p>Events passed quickly. Within a week the Royal
    party had resumed their stay on board the Royal Yacht
    at Cowes. On the 16th the King reviewed the Fleet
    at Spithead, and the next day received on board the
    yacht the Boer Generals Delarey, de Wet, and Botha.
    Towards the end of August the Royal party went for
    a cruise, to work round to Scotland by the West Coast.
    Whenever their Majesties were cruising in the Royal
    Yacht or using her as their home at Cowes, the Marine
    Painter to the Sovereign, the late Cavaliere de Martino,
    was invariably one of the suite in attendance. Martino
    was a great character. A Neapolitan by birth, he had
    subsequently served in the Brazilian Navy, and then
    given up his naval career to become an artist. He had
    a complete knowledge of every detail connected with a
    ship, but, what was far more important, he had the
    real artist&rsquo;s sense of atmosphere, which, for him, meant
    sea and sky, and I am lucky enough to possess several
    of his charming sketches to this day. I used to see a
    great deal of him when he was on board, as, knowing
    a little Italian, I could more or less understand the
    extraordinary sort of lingua franca that he always talked,
    which appeared to be a sort of mixture of Neapolitan,
    Portuguese, and English. The only guests on board,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span> I think, were the Marquis de Soveral, then Portuguese
    Minister, and Mr. and Mrs. Derek Keppel, now
    Sir Derek and Lady Keppel, Sir Derek being the
    well-known Master of the Household to King George.</p>
<p>One of our first stops was made at the Isle of Man,
    which the King and Queen had never seen, and consequently
    desired to visit thoroughly. It was arranged
    that the party was to have a picnic luncheon at some
    historic ruin that is at one end of the island, and then
    drive across to the other side and finish the journey
    back to the landing-place by tramway. The arrangements
    for this expedition automatically fell upon my
    shoulders as Equerry-in-Waiting, and I don&rsquo;t know
    that I have ever spent a more arduous twelve hours.
    It was the middle of the tourist season! I forget the
    exact number of thousands of them that were on the
    island that morning, but I remember that the entire
    local police consisted of a very able Chief Constable
    and, about six men. The tourists were determined to
    see as much of their Sovereign and his Consort as they
    could manage, and though it was the best-intentioned
    and most loyal crowd that I have ever seen, its
    immense size and demonstrative loyalty made it really
    very difficult to cope with. When the drive across the
    island took place, the tourists constituted themselves
    into a vast escort of bicyclists. This was all very well
    as regards the first carriage in which their Majesties
    were driving, but the carriages behind were enveloped
    in such a cloud of dust that the unfortunate coachmen
    literally could not see to drive. Finally, after what
    was for me, to use the modern expression, &ldquo;a hectic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span> day,&rdquo; we arrived back at the port where the boats were
    ready to re-embark us all. The King&rsquo;s carriage drove
    out to the end of the pier, but so great was the crowd
    that the occupants of the other carriages had to get
    out and walk alongside, and in the wake of, this one
    vehicle, and even that was not easy, for the pressure
    was so great, and the crowd so enthusiastic, that one
    had literally to cling to any part of the carriage one
    could get hold of. However all ended well. Their
    Majesties were much gratified with the loyalty and
    friendliness of the people, who were, on their side,
    equally delighted to have their Sovereign and his
    Consort actually in their midst; but personally, being,
    as Equerry, entirely responsible for anything connected
    with journeys, I was extremely relieved, when I found
    myself once again in the decorous surroundings of the
    Royal Yacht.</p>
<p>Another very interesting island visited that autumn
    was Arran, where the Duchess of Hamilton and her
    daughter were established in a shooting-box, which
    literally was a sort of sportsman&rsquo;s paradise. Every
    officer in the ship who could be spared from duty was
    provided with some sort of sport. One party went
    after grouse. Two rifles were sent on the hill, and
    there was excellent salmon and sea-trout fishing for the
    rest. There was also known to be a heavy stag, who
    had taken to leaving the hill and coming down to feed
    on some corn that was in the immediate vicinity of the
    lodge; the King succeeded in shooting him late in
    the evening. The Royal party and their guests had
    spent the afternoon on the fringe of the moor, watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>ing
    some sheep-dog trials; these trials, I believe, are
    constantly held in Wales and Scotland, and are well worth
    watching. Each shepherd works his own dog without
    moving from a certain fixed place, and it is little short
    of marvellous to see how dog and man work together.
    The sheep are in the distance on the hill, and the
    prize is given to the dog who succeeds in turning
    them off the hill, making them go through certain
    gaps, and finally rounding them up in a small enclosure
    in the shortest time, one of the conditions being that
    the sheep are to be herded there, without being
    distressed or exhausted.</p>
<p>Another place visited was Dunrobin, and there again
    excellent sport was provided. There were not a great
    many guests staying at the castle during their Majesties&rsquo;
    visit, but one charming lady, whose acquaintance I
    remember I had that opportunity of making, was Miss
    Irene Vanbrugh, otherwise Mrs. Dion Boucicault.</p>
<p>Shortly after the visit to Dunrobin I was relieved
    by a brother Equerry and went down South.</p>
<p>Whilst on the subject of country houses and sport
    in the North, I may as well mention that, before the
    war, I had made for many years a practice of going to
    Scotland in the autumn, and I can look back with
    infinite pleasure on the many happy and health-giving
    days spent in that very delightful part of the world. At
    many of these places I became almost an annual
    visitor. I am afraid to say how many times I was a
    guest at Tulchan, that delightful lodge and moor on
    Speyside, that was so long tenanted by the late
    Mr. Arthur Sassoon and his charming wife. Year after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span> year I was one of the many who were invited there,
    and had not only excellent sport in very beautiful
    surroundings, but the greatest fun in the most supreme
    comfort; for though only a shooting-lodge, very simply
    arranged, the Chef was super-excellent, and the wine
    matched the Chef! One of the features of Tulchan
    was the number of dogs that literally swarmed there.
    Mrs. Arthur Sassoon herself was an ardent dog-lover,
    and had a string of Skye terriers. Our host had a
    large yellow retriever that was always with him. Every
    male guest thought it incumbent on him to bring a
    retriever, and the ladies of the party invariably
    possessed at least one dog apiece, and I veritably
    believe that had they not possessed a dog to take with
    them to Tulchan, they would have hired one for the
    occasion! So, as I remarked before, dogs swarmed
    there. Poor Major Seymour Wynne Finch (long
    since dead, to the infinite sorrow of his many friends,
    of whom, I am glad to remember, I was one,) was
    another yearly visitor to Tulchan. After one of his
    visits he wrote to thank his hostess for a very pleasant
    visit, adding: &ldquo;it was so nice of you to have such a
    charming lot of dogs to meet me.&rdquo; Moreover, there
    were very few years that passed without the late King,
    or the present King spending a few days of their stay
    in Scotland, as the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur
    Sassoon at Tulchan Lodge, Speyside.</p>
<p>Another place I constantly visited was Strathconan,
    which still belongs to Captain and Lady Jane Combe,
    and here one always found almost everything in
    the shape of sport. To begin with, it is one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span> very best deer forests in Scotland; in addition there
    was some good grouse shooting on the lower ground,
    endless fishing in the lochs and river that flowed past
    close to the lodge, which was itself a picture of comfort,
    and for off-days there was a small but beautifully kept
    golf-course.</p>
<p>Glenquoich was another forest Lodge, where I have
    stayed several times, when in attendance on the late
    King. Lying, as it does, on the West Coast, the
    nearest point of the sea being only some eight miles
    distant, it combined a first-class forest with perhaps
    the most beautiful scenery in Scotland. When on the
    high ground, stalking on a fine day, I do not remember
    ever seeing anything that quite came up to the beauty
    of the scene around. One of the features of the
    scenery consisting in the number of tiny lochs that
    made small patches of that most gorgeous blue that
    combines so well with the colour of the heather and
    the grey-brown of the rocks. The late Lord Burton
    had a lease of Glenquoich for many years, and was
    really a benefactor to the whole neighbourhood, as
    through the long winter months, when life is very
    hard for the gillies (who, in general, have to make all
    they can out of the shooting and stalking season) he
    used to employ them in making pony-paths on the
    hill, so that he could ride pretty nearly all over the
    forest.</p>
<p>Then, for golf purposes, I constantly used to stay
    with my kind friends, Mr. and Mrs. William James,
    who had bought a charming house, Greywalls, built
    by the late Alfred Lyttelton, close to the club house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span> at Muirfield. Since poor Willy James&rsquo; lamented
    death, Greywalls has, I think, recently passed into
    other hands; but probably as a headquarters for
    golfing purposes it could not be surpassed, standing, as
    it did, on a Championship Course, and being within
    the easiest reach of North Berwick, Archerfield, Gullane,
    Gillspindie, Loughness, and indeed many other
    first-rate courses.</p>
<p>I was also a constant visitor at Gordonstown, as the
    guest of Mr. and Mrs. John Hanbury, where there was
    excellent low-ground shooting, and a delightful golf-course
    close by at Lossiemouth.</p>
<p>And, finally, another of my happy hunting-grounds
    has been, and is, Kinross, where, for many years past, I
    have been the guest of Sir Basil and Lady Montgomery,
    at their beautiful home on the shores of Loch Leven.
    Kinross deserves more than a passing mention. The
    beauty of the situation of the house is alone worthy of
    note. Built to face the island on the loch, where
    Queen Mary of Scots was imprisoned, I know nothing
    more beautiful in the way of a peaceful landscape, than
    the view from the windows. It commences with a
    foreground of walled garden, the centre of which is
    formally laid out and terminated by an imposing gate-way,
    known as the Fish Gate. Immediately opposite,
    as a mid-distance, is the principal island of Loch Leven,
    with its ruined castle embowered in trees, with various
    smaller islands dotted about, and the whole group
    encircled by the waters of the loch. In the distance
    are the outlines of the low Fife hills; while, as a finish
    to the picture, the loch is framed by the massive bastions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span> of hill formed by Fife-Lomond and Glenarty, which
    rear themselves up from the placid waters to the right
    and left. The house, too, is very beautiful and interesting.
    The first owner and architect of the present
    building was Sir William Bruce, and there is a tradition
    that he built, with the object of disposing of it to the
    Duke of York for a Scottish residence when his succession
    to the Throne was in doubt, at the time of the
    passing of the Exclusive Bill. This hope, if it ever
    existed, speedily came to an end, for before Kinross
    House was finished, the Duke of York had ascended
    the Throne as James II, and had Holyrood for a
    Scottish palace. Kinross House is a fine example of
    one of the early mansions of the Scotch Renaissance.
    It contains many beautiful things, principal amongst
    which is a fine staircase, with pierced and carved panels,
    which leads directly to the ball-room, a very large
    saloon taking up the greater part of the first floor.
    In the saloon are hung, amongst other family pictures,
    a very fine full-length portrait of Lady Montgomery
    by Raeburn, faced by a Hoppner of Lady Elizabeth
    Montgomery, and there are two very good three-quarter-length
    Romneys of the Marquis and Marchioness of
    Townshend. Altogether, the house and its surroundings
    make up one of the most beautiful and &ldquo;liveable&rdquo;
    homes that I have ever come across in my wanderings
    in Scotland.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>
<h3>KING EDWARD&rsquo;S FOREIGN TOUR</h3>
<p>In the spring of 1903 I was one of the suite in
    attendance on the occasion of King Edward&rsquo;s official
    visits to the Capitals of France, Portugal and Italy.
    The sea route having been selected, His Majesty took
    the opportunity of visiting Gibraltar and Malta at the
    same time.</p>
<p>There are not wanting those who are of opinion that
    this expedition was what Sir Sidney Lee, in his biographical
    notice, calls a &ldquo;vacation exercise.&rdquo; Others,
    including a humble spectator, such as myself, think, on
    the other hand, that our subsequent happy relations
    with France are mainly due to the personal characteristics
    and influence of King Edward himself. At any
    rate every man is entitled to his own opinion, and,
    having expressed mine, I go on to say that those five
    weeks,&mdash;more especially the days of them that were
    passed in Paris,&mdash;were among the most interesting of
    my life. Under these circumstances I think it worth
    while to give the names of those who were in attendance
    during the trip.</p>
<p>The King embarked on board the Royal Yacht, <i>Victoria and Albert</i>, on March 30th. The Marquis de
    Soveral, Portuguese Minister in London, was a guest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span> on board, as far as Lisbon, and the suite in attendance
    were as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The Hon. Charles Hardinge (now Lord Hardinge
        of Penshurst), Minister Plenipotentiary.</p>
    <p>The late Major-General Sir Stanley Clarke, Equerry
        and Acting Master of the Household.</p>
    <p>Rear-Admiral the Hon. Hedworth Lambton (now
        Admiral of the Fleet Sir Hedworth Meux),
        Extra Equerry and in command of the Royal Yacht.</p>
    <p>The late Sir Francis Laking, Physician in Ordinary.</p>
    <p>Captain Frederick Ponsonby (now Colonel Sir
        Frederick Ponsonby), Equerry and Acting
        Private Secretary.</p>
    <p>The late Cavaliere de Martino, Marine Painter to
        His Majesty.</p>
    <p>And another Equerry in the person of myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the following day the Royal Yacht proceeded
    on her journey to Lisbon, escorted by the cruisers <i>Venus and Minerva</i>; and not encountering the best of
    weather, rolled very heavily on her passage across the
    Bay. When approaching the entrance to the Tagus on
    April 2nd, our escort was reinforced by four Portuguese
    ships of war, which made the procession up the
    river quite an imposing spectacle.</p>
<p>As soon as the Royal Yacht had taken up her moorings
    she was boarded by King Carlos and his brother,
    the Duke of Oporto, and their Suites. They arrived
    in a procession of Royal Barges, the leading boat being
    certainly one of the most curious and beautiful craft
    that I have ever seen afloat. She was built in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span> eighteenth century, with a huge dragon, the arms of
    Braganza, as a figure-head, and pulled twenty oars a
    side, each oar being double manned, which made up a
    crew of over eighty, all dressed in scarlet caps and
    jackets. Never have I seen such a smart turn-out
    afloat. The coaches, too, which conveyed the King to
    the Necessidades Palace, where he took up his abode,
    were mainly about two hundred years old, and magnificently
    horsed,&mdash;or rather, to be accurate, &ldquo;muled.&rdquo;
    Nearly all the Royal carriage work at Lisbon used to
    be done by splendid mules well over sixteen hands high.</p>
<p>The two monarchs landed together in the forty-oared
    boat, and processed through the streets of Lisbon
    with the usual ceremonies to the Palace, where King
    Edward was received by the Dowager Queen Maria
    Pia. The usual addresses inevitable on those occasions
    were presented, and responded to, during the course of
    the visit; there was the customary State banquet, and
    every hour of the day was occupied. But there was
    time for a short visit to the Royal Palace of Peña,
    situated at the very summit of the mountain of Cintra,
    which I have attempted to describe before; and on the
    Sunday, after Service at the English Church, the King
    took luncheon at the Legation, with the British
    Minister, Sir Martin Gosselin, and his wife.</p>
<p>The afternoon before the Royal Yacht sailed was
    given up to what was looked upon (anyhow by the
    people of Lisbon) as the most important part of the
    whole visit, namely a bull-fight. A Portuguese bull-fight
    is an extraordinarily beautiful spectacle. The
    bull has his horns padded, and so good are the horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> and so well are they handled that, as a general rule,
    not a horse is ever touched by the bull, and the bull
    is only irritated by pin pricks in the literal sense, the
    lances used by the picadors having nothing more formidable
    at their points than a useful-sized pin. So
    neither man, horse, nor bull is any the worse, and when
    the latter is getting tired he is man-handled by some of
    the under-strappers of the ring and taken back to his
    stall. But the beauty of the spectacle really consists in
    its details and surroundings.</p>
<p>The bull-fighters arrive at the arena in a procession
    of delightful old coaches, with six horses apiece and
    endless outriders, from which they slowly descend with
    great pomp. They are all beautifully turned out, the
    picadors in particular being gorgeously apparelled and
    splendidly mounted. The surroundings consist in the
    huge amphitheatre, packed with people, (the women
    being all in bright colours), and a cloudless blue sky.
    When the performance begins, what with the bull
    charging, and the horsemen worrying him, the cries of
    the spectators, and the clanging of bands,&mdash;even the
    most callous spectator finds himself being carried away,
    and becomes gradually roused to some slight measure
    of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>On the 7th April the visit to Lisbon terminated, and
    the Royal Yacht was once more under way <i>en route</i> to
    Gibraltar.</p>
<p>And now for the practical outcome of the visit.</p>
<p>Just before the King started from England a very
    mischievous article had been published in a newspaper,
    hinting that the object of the visit to Lisbon was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> acquisition of Delagoa Bay; indeed, vague rumours to
    that effect had been in circulation for some time. This <i>canard</i> was at once seized upon by the Anglophobe
    journals of the Portuguese and foreign Press, and great
    capital was being made of it. In the course of his
    speech, when accepting an address from the Commercial
    Association of Portugal, the King took the opportunity
    of saying that &ldquo;Our respective countries and
    colonies, the integrity and preservation of which is
    one of my dearest aims and objects.&rdquo; This announcement
    absolutely put an end to all the mischief at once.
    The Prime Minister of Portugal expressed his gratification
    to Sir Martin Gosselin, who happened to be
    standing near him, for what he described as &ldquo;those
    golden words.&rdquo; In fact, in a few seconds more was done
    to remove a cause of friction between two countries than
    could have been accomplished in the same number of
    months by official correspondence.</p>
<p>In lovely weather the Royal Yacht made her way to
    Gibraltar, where she arrived on the following day. An
    address of welcome was presented by a deputation from
    the Chamber of Commerce, to which a reply was duly
    given. There was an official dinner at the Convent
    given by the Governor, who was then the late Sir
    George White, the stout-hearted soldier who had so
    resolutely defended Ladysmith. The King, in responding
    to the toast of his health, took the opportunity
    of announcing his intention of promoting General
    Sir George White to the rank of Field-Marshal. No
    announcement could have been better received, as
    Sir George White, a very gallant man, and a loyal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span> capable soldier, was exceedingly popular, not only in
    Gibraltar but throughout the Army.</p>
<p>It was during the King&rsquo;s visit that I first had the
    pleasure of making the acquaintance of Sir Arthur
    Nicolson, then Minister at Tangier (since then so well
    known as our Ambassador in Russia, and subsequently
    as Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs.
    He recently became Lord Carnock). He came over to
    present the Envoy of the Sultan of Morocco, and bore
    a letter from His Shereefian Majesty to King Edward.
    This Envoy rejoiced in a name so gorgeous that it is
    well worth while to print it&mdash;Cid Abderrahman ben
    Abdelsadok! The Governor of Algeciras also paid an
    official visit, arriving in a Spanish gunboat; but with
    the exception of a review of the troops of the garrison
    there was no other official function. The King was, of
    course, shown all the newest work in connection with
    the defences of the fortress and the developments of
    the dockyard, where he laid the first stone of a new
    dry dock. Personally, having spent a good deal of my
    youth there in frequent short visits, I was delighted to
    have a look at Gib. (as we all used to call it) again.</p>
<p>During the Royal Yacht&rsquo;s stay at Gibraltar, it had
    been arranged that a squadron of battleships of the
    Channel Fleet should be there under the command of
    Rear-Admiral Curzon-Howe, but with King Edward&rsquo;s
    usual genius for doing the right and gracious thing, at
    his suggestion the squadron was ordered to Algiers in
    order to salute the French President, Monsieur Loubet,
    on his arrival there, in connection with some official
    function.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>
<p>On the morning of April 13th, the Royal Yacht
    with her escort, which had been reinforced by four
    more cruisers belonging to the Mediterranean Station,
    left for Malta. <i>En route</i> we passed near enough to
    Algiers to be saluted by the shore batteries and by the
    Russian, Spanish and Italian ships that were there in
    compliment to the French President, and on the 16th the
    Royal Yacht steamed into the Grand Harbour, Valetta.</p>
<p>Never have I seen that most picturesque of harbours
    looking better. It was a day of brilliant sunshine; all
    the ships in the harbour were dressed; there seemed
    to me to be more of those gaily painted <i>dhaisas</i> than
    ever, and as for the old knight&rsquo;s fortifications, they
    were almost black with the crowds that came to see,
    and acclaim, the first British Sovereign who had ever
    visited their historic island.</p>
<p>On landing, the King was received by the Governor-General,
    Sir Mansfield Clarke, and the Naval Commander-in-Chief,
    Admiral Sir Compton Domville, and
    drove with the Governor to the palace. During the
    afternoon endless deputations were received, and later
    in the day the King held a levée, which was attended by
    the officers of the Fleet and Garrison and the Government
    officials. There were the usual official dinners
    at the Palace, and on board Sir Compton Domville&rsquo;s
    flagship the <i>Bulwark</i>; a review of the troops of the
    Garrison, and the day before the visit ended a review of
    the seamen and marines of the Fleet at the Marsa,
    where I had so often played polo and raced ponies in
    the days of my youth. It was a good show. Eight
    thousand bluejackets and marines duly marched past,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span> and I believe it was the first time that Aides-de-Camp
    had ever been mounted on bicycles,&mdash;the &ldquo;gallopers,&rdquo;
    consisting of a number of midshipmen on wheels.
    What I confess interested me most was to see again
    the beautiful Gobelin tapestries that are hung on all
    great occasions round the whole of the interior of
    St. John&rsquo;s Cathedral. It is very seldom that they are
    all produced, but of course for the King&rsquo;s visit they
    were very much in evidence.</p>
<p>The last evening at Malta was given up to a water
    carnival and illuminations that had been organised by
    the Fleet. The feature of the carnival was a procession
    of miniature ships, twelve in number, ranging from
    Noak&rsquo;s Ark to H.M.S. <i>Edward VII</i>, which was then
    our latest battleship. Some of the twelve I can
    remember: there was a Greek Galley, a Chinese War
    Junk, a Roman Trireme, the <i>Revenge</i> (Grenville&rsquo;s
    flagship at the Azores), and the immortal <i>Victory</i>.
    Every unit of this quaint fleet, with the crews dressed
    in the supposed costumes of the various periods
    represented, passed by the Royal Yacht either under
    oars or under their miniature sails. Evidently the
    details had been carefully studied, and much loving
    care had been bestowed on the white dove that flew in
    and out of the Ark!</p>
<p>And now for the practical value of this Royal visit
    to Malta,&mdash;and considering the many years that I have
    passed, on and off, as man and boy, in that little island,
    I think I may venture to claim some slight knowledge
    of its inhabitants. To begin with, I like the Maltese;
    even now, if I were to go back to Valetta, I am sure I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span> should find some old boatman, tradesman, club-servant,
    or horse-coper, who would still remember,
    and be glad to see me. It must be realised that
    Malta literally swarms with priests: indeed one of its
    few drawbacks as a winter residence is the never-ending
    clanging of bells in the multitudinous churches
    there. Small wonder, then, that there is a strong
    clerical party of very extreme views, and, as usual, this
    party consists not only of the members of the priesthood
    themselves, but also of a large section of the
    Maltese nobility. These gentry,&mdash;I expect in humble
    imitation of what are known as the &ldquo;Papalini&rdquo; in
    Rome,&mdash;are violently pro-Italian and anti-English,
    just as the afore-mentioned &ldquo;Papalini&rdquo; were, and, for
    all I know, are, almost to a man, pro-German and
    opposed to their own Government. The result of this
    is, that trouble is apt to be stirred up at Malta by the
    local Press. Everything English is reviled, and an
    immense amount of mud is thrown at us. But I am
    convinced that all the best of the Maltese upper classes,
    and the entire peasantry and working classes, when not
    too severely priest-ridden, are thoroughly conscious that
    they are extremely well off under the Union Jack, and
    have not really the smallest desire to become Italian
    subjects. They like, however, to flirt with the idea.
    As the Irishman said when comparing Home Rule to
    Heaven, &ldquo;Every one wants to go there eventually, but
    no one had ever been met with who was ready to
    go there next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effect of the King&rsquo;s visit and his remarkable
    personality was immediate. The minority, who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span> always there striving to stir up disaffection, were
    reduced at any rate to comparative silence for some
    considerable time, owing to the remarkable demonstration
    of loyalty and affection that was shown towards
    the King by the bulk of the population.</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>On April 21st the Royal Yacht, escorted by the
    Mediterranean Fleet, passed through the Straits of
    Messina and proceeded to Naples. The Fleet must
    have given the tourists at Taormina a fine show, consisting,
    as it did, of eight battleships and four cruisers,
    to say nothing of the small craft in the shape of
    destroyers, with the Royal Yacht flying the standard,
    leading between the two lines of battleships. I have
    passed up and down those same Straits many scores of
    times, during my service in the Navy, and on every
    occasion that I have seen it I have been more and more
    obsessed by its beauty. The loveliness of the surroundings
    there never palls, and one of the only
    advantages of getting old is that one becomes more and
    more appreciative of both artistic and natural beauties.
    I have stood outside the temple at Taormina in
    brilliant sunshine, when a slight rain squall in the
    Straits has bridged Sicily and the mainland with a
    perfect rainbow, and the difficulty is then to decide
    whether the view of the Straits from the land on
    either coast, or the view of both coasts from the sea,
    when passing through the Straits, is the more magnificent.
    Meanwhile, the last is generally the best, and
    my last passage through, up to the time of writing,
    was on this particular occasion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>
<p>After having left the Straits behind us, as there were
    two or three hours to spare, the Yacht and Fleet
    steamed slowly through the Lipari Islands. The small
    volcano that exists on the crest of the Island of Stromboli
    really behaved remarkably well on the occasion.
    Just at dusk, when only a few hundred yards off the
    island, the Royal Yacht was indulged with three
    successive and very considerable explosions, formidable
    enough to send up clouds of flame and smoke, to say
    nothing of stones, that fell hissing into the sea.
    Whether a volcano can be treated in a medical way I
    know not, but at the time, I had a strong personal
    suspicion that the leading inhabitants must have
    administered some sort of emetic to the mountain to
    produce these happily-timed explosions. On the other
    hand, it might only have been an instance of extreme
    tact on the part of Dame Nature. Anyhow, it made a
    very beautiful spectacle, and was at once immortalised
    by my friend Martino, who made a very lovely water-colour
    sketch of it.</p>
<p>Naples was reached on April 23rd in abominable
    weather. This, mercifully, did not last long, as it was
    the King&rsquo;s intention to stay there for three or four days
    before proceeding on his official visit to Rome. The
    Royal Yacht accordingly was berthed inside the Mole,
    and four very pleasant days were spent&mdash;a welcome
    relaxation to all concerned, after the continual
    functions.</p>
<p>A very old friend of mine, then Sir Francis Bertie
    (who, alas! as Lord Bertie, died very recently), was
    then Ambassador in Rome, and he and the late Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span> Rolfe, then still Consul at Naples&mdash;another very old
    friend&mdash;were speedily on board to pay their respects.
    There were a number of yachts at Naples at the time,
    with owners obviously lying in wait for the King&rsquo;s
    arrival, and soon there was a considerable influx of
    visitors. Queen Amelie, then Queen of Portugal, was
    with her son, the present ex-King Manoel, on board
    her yacht. A cutter belonging to the Duke of the
    Abruzzi, an enthusiastic yachtsman, and also an old
    Cowes acquaintance and friend of the King&rsquo;s, was
    in the port, as were also the yachts of the German
    Crown Prince, with Prince Eitel Friedrich, and of
    Mr. and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt. Though it was
    announced that the King&rsquo;s visit was entirely private
    and unofficial, he was most warmly greeted by the
    Neapolitans wherever he landed, and, as a concession
    to the wish expressed by the Mayor, consented to be
    present at a gala performance at the Opera.</p>
<p>During the next three or four days various excursions
    were made, one to the Royal Palace of
    Caserta, which I had not seen since I was a small
    midshipman, another to Posilipo, where Lord Rosebery
    was in residence at his charming villa (now made
    over by him to the country as a summer residence for
    our Ambassador in Rome). So what with excursions,
    and sight-seeing, the days passed like a flash.</p>
<p>On the 27th the King left Naples for Rome.
    Admiral Lambton, who had just been relieved of his
    command (of the Royal Yachts) by his successor, Sir
    Berkeley Milne, travelled on with us, in attendance on
    His Majesty as extra Equerry-in-Waiting.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>
<p>The Royal train arrived at Rome in the early afternoon,
    and the King, after being received at the station
    by the King of Italy, who was accompanied by the
    Royal Dukes of Genoa, of Aosta, of the Abruzzi, and
    the Count of Turin, proceeded to the Quirinal Palace
    where His Majesty and the whole of his suite were
    lodged.</p>
<p>As always, during the three days that the official
    visit lasted, there was no rest for the King, every
    hour of the day and evening being fully occupied.
    Official visits had to be paid, a deputation of the
    British Community was received at the British Embassy,
    Foreign Ambassadors and Chefs de Mission
    were received; there was a gala dinner at the palace,
    a gala performance at the Opera, and the review of
    a large number of Italian troops. In reality, far the
    most interesting incident was the visit the King paid
    to the Pope. I regretted at the time, and I regret
    still, that I was not one of the suite present on that
    occasion. Though I am not particularly wrapped up, in
    what the French call <i>la calotte</i>, Pope Leo XIII was
    such a very remarkable personality, as well as such
    a great Pope, that I should like to have the recollection
    of having seen him, and his royal guest, together
    at the Vatican. The visit was, naturally, rather a
    delicate matter. The Government of England, in
    their eternal terror of the Nonconformist conscience,
    and their natural love of the line of least resistance,
    were of course against it. There were also difficulties
    of etiquette as to His Majesty visiting the Vatican
    whilst a guest at the Quirinal Palace. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span> the King was anxious that, though his visit should
    be considered private and informal, it should be made
    on the initiative of the Pope, to the extent of a letter
    being sent to the Ambassador acquainting him with
    the fact, that the Holy Father expressed a desire to
    see the King, if it were His Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure to pay
    him a visit. All the details were settled, I believe,
    at an interview between Cardinal Rampolla and Mr.
    Hardinge, and any awkwardness that might arise from
    being in residence at the Quirinal, was got over by
    starting from the Embassy in Sir Frank Bertie&rsquo;s private
    carriage. As usual, the King was right. His visit to
    the Pope was accepted by the King of Italy and the
    Italian Government as a matter of course. It was
    popular in Italy and, naturally, with all King Edward&rsquo;s
    Catholic subjects, and the entire Italian Press, of all
    shades, commented most favourably on it.</p>
<p>And so ended the Italian visit. It was a complete
    success and gave pleasure to all classes in Italy from
    the King and Pope down to the small tradesmen and <i>contadini</i>.</p>
<p>The Royal train left Rome on the morning of
    April 30th on its way to Paris. The only feature
    of interest on the journey was that at Pisa, where the
    train made a short stop, the Duchesse d&rsquo;Aosta took
    advantage of this delay to board the train and pay
    a short farewell visit to the King. As Princesse
    Hélene d&rsquo;Orleans she had, of course, lived a great
    deal in England before her marriage, and was extremely
    intimate with our Royal Family.</p>
<p>At Dijon next morning the official visit to France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span> really commenced, for there the train took up, as
    additional passengers, Sir Edmund Monson, British
    Ambassador in Paris, who was accompanied by the
    Naval and Military Attachés of the Embassy, Captain
    Charles Ottley, R.N., now so well known as Sir
    Charles Ottley, who served for some time as Secretary
    of the Defence Committee, and the present General
    the Hon. Edward Stuart Wortley, then a Lieutenant-Colonel.
    With them arrived the French officers who
    were attached to the King during his visit&mdash;le Vice-Admiral
    Fournier, le Général de Lacroix, and an old
    friend of mine, and a very popular personage in Paris
    Society, le Commandant Chabaud, belonging to the
    Military household of the President.</p>
<p>After leaving Dijon, the Royal train ran straight
    through to the station of the Bois de Boulogne in
    Paris, where the King was met by the President
    of the Republic, (Monsieur Loubet), the Presidents
    of the two Chambers, and all the highest Military
    and Civil Authorities of the Capital. The customary
    presentations having been made, His Majesty and
    Monsieur Loubet entered the President&rsquo;s state carriage
    and, followed by the carriages conveying the suite,
    the personnel of the British Embassy and the French
    Ministers, moved off in a procession to the British
    Embassy in the Rue du Faubourg St. Honoré, that
    beautiful house, formerly the residence of the great
    Napoleon&rsquo;s sister, Pauline Borghese, which was acquired
    for our nation by the first Duke of Wellington.</p>
<p>The streets were lined with troops, and there was
    a large escort of Cuirassiers of the Garde Republicaine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span> An immense crowd had collected in the streets, and
    the windows and balconies of the houses on the route
    were crammed with spectators, but, in the interests
    of truth, I am compelled to state that, though not
    unfriendly, the reception was distinctly chilly.</p>
<p>There was not room in the Embassy for the whole
    of the suite, so a portion of it, of which I was one,
    was quartered at the Hôtel Bristol in the Place
    Vendôme, which was conveniently near our &ldquo;Headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the usual ceremonial visit to the President at
    the Élysée, the next official function was the reception
    of the President and a Deputation of the British
    Chamber of Commerce in Paris by the King, and in
    his reply to the address presented by the Deputation,
    one of the first steps forward was taken towards the
    establishment of an Entente between England and
    France. In the course of his speech the King made
    use of these words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Divine Providence has designed that France
    should be our near neighbour, and, I hope, always
    a dear friend. There are no two countries in the
    world whose mutual prosperity is more dependent on
    each other. There may have been misunderstandings
    and causes of dissension in the past, but all such
    differences are, I believe, happily removed and forgotten,
    and I trust that the friendship and admiration
    which we all feel for the French nation and their
    glorious traditions may in the near future develop
    into a sentiment of the warmest affection and attachment
    between the peoples of the two countries. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span> achievement of this aim is my constant desire, and,
    gentlemen, I count upon your institution, and each
    of its members severally, who reside in this beautiful
    city and enjoy the hospitality of the French Republic,
    to aid and assist me in the attainment of this object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most favourable impression was made in Paris,
    by the immediate publication of the King&rsquo;s speech.</p>
<p>The first evening in Paris was a comparatively quiet
    one, but after a small private dinner at the Embassy,
    the King and his suite went to the Théâtre Français
    to see Maurice Donnay&rsquo;s play, <i>l&rsquo;Autre Danger</i>, the
    President and Madame Loubet being also present.</p>
<p>Next morning the President came round to the
    Embassy at nine, and the King left in the President&rsquo;s
    carriage in his company for Vincennes, where the
    review was held. The greeting he received from the
    crowd was noticeably far warmer than on his arrival
    the previous day. The review was admirably conducted.
    There was an unusually large force of
    cavalry on the ground, and I, personally, was much
    impressed with the quality of the horses, and the
    admirable horsemanship of the men. A very few
    years later I happened to be present at a large
    man&#339;uvre review of troops near Breslau, and, to my
    mind, there was no comparison between the cavalry
    of the two nations, France and Germany. In every
    way, the French, except no doubt in point of numbers,
    were infinitely superior. As an instance of the way
    in which some of the crack cavalry corps were
    mounted, I noticed at Vincennes that the same man,
    was riding the same horse, in that part of the escort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span> that was close to the carriage of which I was an
    occupant. For a troop-horse to carry a heavy man
    (probably in his full kit putting up some eighteen
    stone) at a fast trot for the best part of eighteen miles,
    even with a good interval of rest while the review was
    taking place, will, I am sure, be acknowledged by
    any English cavalry officer as being no inconsiderable
    performance, testifying, as it does, alike to excellence
    and good condition.</p>
<p>On his return journey to the Embassy, after the
    termination of the review, the King stopped for a few
    minutes at the Hôtel de Ville, where he was received
    by M. Deville, the President of the Municipal Council.
    In answer to the toast of his health, the King replied
    in the following words, which merit being quoted in
    full, the concluding sentence doing more, perhaps, to
    complete the success of his visit than any other utterance
    that was made in Paris:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Je désire vous exprimer combien je suis vivement
    touché de vos bonnes paroles. Il aurait été fâcheux,
    en passant par votre belle ville, de ne pouvoir
    m&rsquo;arrêter a l&rsquo;Hôtel de Ville. Bien sincèrement, je
    vous remercie de l&rsquo;accueil que vous m&rsquo;avez fait
    aujourd&rsquo;hui.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Je n&rsquo;oublierai jamais ma visite à votre charmante
    ville, et je puis vous assurer que c&rsquo;est avec le plus
    grand plaisir que je reviens à Paris, où je me trouve
    toujours comme si j&rsquo;étais chez moi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the return to the Embassy, the President took
    leave of the King, and His Majesty entertained a few
    of his old friends at luncheon, before attending a race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>-meeting
    that was to take place at Longchamps in the
    afternoon.</p>
<p>Amongst some of those present at the luncheon
    were Prince d&rsquo;Arenberg, Duc de la Force, Général le
    Marquis de Gallifet, the Marquis and Marquise de
    Jaucourt, Mr. and Mrs. Standish, Admiral Duperré,
    Prince Mohamed Ali, and the Marquis de Soveral,
    who was on a private visit to Paris.</p>
<p>The race-meeting was an enormous success. It
    was a lovely day and all Paris was there. The
    King&rsquo;s reception, instead of being chilly, was
    enthusiastic. The races were all named after some
    of the King&rsquo;s most famous horses, and for one of
    them, the Persimmon Stakes of £1000, he had
    offered a splendid gold cup as an additional prize.
    The greater part of the time was spent by him in the
    Presidential box, with his official host and hostess;
    but towards the end of the afternoon he passed a few
    minutes with some of his old friends in the Jockey
    Club stand.</p>
<p>Rarely have I witnessed such friendliness and
    enthusiasm as was evinced by this huge crowd, and,
    moreover, there were not a few Frenchmen present who
    were secretly delighted at being able to shout &ldquo;Vive
    le Roi&rdquo; without being arrested by a policeman!</p>
<p>The evening was given up to the official dinner at
    the Élysée, followed by a gala performance at the
    Opera.</p>
<p>Once more the best possible impression was conveyed
    by the King&rsquo;s speech in answer to the toast of
    his health, and in toasting the President of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> Republic and drinking to the prosperity and grandeur
    of France.</p>
<p>In the course of his speech he touched his audience
    by a phrase he used: &ldquo;Je connais Paris depuis mon
    enfance; j&rsquo;y suis revenu bien des fois, et j&rsquo;ai toujours
    admireé la beauté de cette ville unique et l&rsquo;esprit de
    ses habitants,&rdquo;&mdash;while, later on, he used the words:
    &ldquo;Notre grand désir est que nous marchions ensemble,
    dans la voie de la civilisation et de la paix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a very representative company at the
    banquet. I heard that there were over 130 guests
    present,&mdash;amongst numberless other celebrities an old
    acquaintance of mine, M. Victorien Sardou, the
    dramatist, was there; M. Carolus Duran and M.
    Saint-Saëns were also pointed out to me.</p>
<p>In connection with the King&rsquo;s speech on this
    occasion, I remember that two or three of the leading
    representatives of the Press came to see Fritz Ponsonby
    and myself after our return from the races, and asked
    us kindly to supply them with the King&rsquo;s speech in
    writing, as it was very important that, having to be
    published broadcast, and telegraphed all over the world,
    it should be absolutely word perfect. We could only
    tell them in answer to their request that it was quite
    impossible. We had no knowledge whatever of what
    the King was going to say; that, probably, he would
    not even write it himself, as he habitually spoke
    without notes unless he had to deal with a mass of
    figures. Polite incredulity was visibly expressed in
    their faces, but obviously there was nothing more to
    be done for the present, so they withdrew. After the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span> gala they came round again, and this time we had to
    produce something. By appealing to the King himself,
    and by pooling our joint memories we succeeded in
    evolving what was probably quite an accurate version,
    but a copy was impossible, for the speech had never
    been written. The astonishment of those worthies
    was prodigious; they were really <i>épaté</i>&mdash;to use their
    own expression&mdash;at the King&rsquo;s nerve and confidence in
    himself, in being able to make one of the most important
    speeches of his life, (except for the careful
    thought that no doubt preceded it), in this extempore
    fashion.</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday. The King and his suite,
    and the personnel of the Embassy, duly attended
    Divine Service at the little English Church in the
    Rue d&rsquo;Aguesseau, that stands almost opposite the
    Embassy.</p>
<p>After Church there was a huge luncheon at the
    Ministry for Foreign Affairs. All the Foreign
    Ambassadors and Ministers were present, and altogether
    there were something like a hundred guests.
    After luncheon I remember that the King had a long
    conversation with M. Waldeck Rousseau; but I have
    no further knowledge of anything else that happened
    on that afternoon, for Prince d&rsquo;Arenberg, one of the
    leading racing men in France (I think he was the
    President of the Jockey Club), came up to Hedworth
    Lambton and myself and suggested that, if we could
    decently slip away, he would drive us down to Longchamps
    where there was a good day&rsquo;s racing on. The
    King, with his usual good nature, readily assented, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span> away we went, and spent a very pleasant afternoon
    with our many French racing friends. It was delightful
    to hear the enthusiasm with which they, one and
    all, spoke of our King, and of the wonderful success of
    his visit.</p>
<p>The last evening was spent at the Embassy, where
    the King gave a great dinner to the President and
    Madame Loubet, to the members of the French
    Government and their wives, and the heads of Foreign
    Missions. After dinner there was a concert, the
    music being provided by some of the artists of the
    Opera, and this, practically brought the Paris visit to a
    conclusion.</p>
<p>The next morning the King started for home via
    Cherbourg. The train left, after a very cordial leave-taking
    with the President, at eleven o&rsquo;clock, and
    arrived at its destination in the evening. There was
    the usual official reception on arrival, and subsequently
    the King entertained all the principal Naval, Military,
    and Civil Authorities at dinner on board the Royal
    Yacht, and left the next morning for Portsmouth.</p>
<p>As so ended this journey of five weeks.</p>
<p>I have already commented on what I believe to have
    been the useful work done at the other Capitals that
    were visited. To my mind, the visit to France was
    infinitely the most important, and the most fruitful, of
    them all. For many preceding years I had spent
    weeks, if not months, of every year in France, and I
    knew well, since Fashoda, how strained the relations
    between the two countries had become;&mdash;naturally, I
    am only speaking from the point of view of a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span> ordinary spectator. It was evident to me that, though
    not actually uncivil, one&rsquo;s old friends in Paris, and on
    the Riviera, were anxious to avoid one, when they
    could decently do so. Probably the estrangement
    there was between individuals was also existing quite
    as strongly amongst the officials of the two countries;
    but from the time of the King&rsquo;s visit onwards, there
    has certainly been steady improvement, culminating in
    the alliance that has held together during the years of
    the lately finished war. I venture to maintain that,
    though this same result might have been brought
    about gradually by the politicians of the two countries,
    only one man in the world, and that man was King
    Edward, could have established, what was almost an
    immediate <i>rapprochement</i>, between our two great nations.
    The difference between the civil, but chilly, welcome
    that was extended to him on his arrival, and the
    enthusiastic reception that he received everywhere, in
    an increasing measure, during the last days of his visit
    was due to his personality, charm, and tact. As an
    instance of the change in the feeling of Parisians for
    Englishmen that took place during those few days, I
    can give a personal experience. Owing to some
    oversight in the giving of an order, on the evening of
    our arrival, those of us who were lodged at the Bristol
    found ourselves later on, standing outside the hotel,
    waiting impatiently for a carriage in which to drive
    round to the Embassy. There was a huge crowd in
    the Place Vendôme, and the neighbouring streets, and
    to walk round was impossible. Meanwhile, those of
    the crowd who were in our vicinity, quickly realising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span> our embarrassment, manifested the greatest delight, and
    almost openly jeered at us. Eventually the carriage
    arrived, and while it was forcing its way slowly through
    the crowd, some of them put their heads close to the
    windows and raised the cry of &ldquo;Vivent les Boers.&rdquo; I am
    afraid I could not resist the very obvious repartee,
    &ldquo;Vivent les Boers, pourquoi pas? ce sont nos sujets
    maintenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three days later there was again some delay about
    the carriage, and we were once more waiting outside the
    hotel. If anything the crowd was even denser, but
    instead of being treated with discourtesy, we met, on
    the other hand, with the greatest kindness. A French
    gentleman detached himself from the crowd, and said
    that he had noticed our difficulty, but fortunately he
    could come to our assistance, and begged us to make
    use of his own carriage, which was waiting round the
    corner. When the hour arrived for the King to leave
    the French Capital I shall never forget the enthusiasm
    of the French crowds that lined the streets to bid him
    farewell before his journey home. That he had always
    been popular in Paris from his youth up, is quite true;
    but at no time was he more so, than when this official
    visit came to an end on the 10th of May, 1903.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Hardinge, who acted as Minister
    Potentiary in attendance on His Majesty during the
    trip, wrote an admirable little book in the shape of a <i>Short Record of the King&rsquo;s Journey, March 30th-May 5th</i>,
    1903. This little work was completed by June 5th
    of the same year, and so was written when everything
    that occurred was fresh in the memory of the writer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>
<p>With his kind permission, I will, while thanking him
    for the assistance his book has been to me in writing
    my recollections of that time, quote the sentence with
    which he concludes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honour to whom honour is due. It only remains
    for the writer of this record to respectfully state his
    conviction that the success of the King&rsquo;s journey and
    the happy results which may be confidently anticipated
    therefrom, are entirely due to his Majesty&rsquo;s own
    personality, to his courteous tact, to his frank and
    genial manner, and to his unrivalled knowledge of men
    and of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER  XII</a></h2>
<h3>MARIENBAD AND OTHER HEALTH RESORTS</h3>
<p>In July 1903 President Loubet arrived in England
    on a return visit to the one I have attempted to describe
    in my last chapter. He arrived in London on the 6th
    and was lodged at York House, St. James&rsquo;s Palace, as
    the guest of the King.</p>
<p>The English Mission attached to him during his
    visit consisted of Lord Howe, then a Lord-in-Waiting
    to the King, as Chef de Mission, General Sir Reginald
    Talbot, at one time Military Attaché in Paris, Admiral
    Sir Lewis Beaumont, Captain Ottley and Lieutenant-Colonel
    Stuart Wortley, the Naval and Military
    Attachés in Paris, and myself.</p>
<p>One official visit is very like another. Apparently
    the necessary procedure is that every hour of the
    visiting Potentate&rsquo;s day, from 8 a.m. until past midnight,
    should be filled up; a somewhat exhausting
    process for all concerned, but as the official visit only
    lasts from three to four days, as a general rule, no
    harm to life or health ensues. There is always a
    banquet, and a review of troops, and the illustrious
    visitor, be he King or President, invariably receives the
    resident Corps Diplomatique, as well as a deputation
    of his own countrymen, in what is theoretically a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span> portion of his own fatherland, namely at the Embassy
    of his own country. The principal duty of the officers
    of the Mission, is to see that their illustrious charge
    and his suite, are produced punctually for all the
    unending functions, and, generally, to look after their
    comfort. Though there is a great sameness about
    these visits, there is nearly always something of interest
    to remember about them, and President Loubet&rsquo;s was
    no exception.</p>
<p>To begin with, it was the first time in history that a
    French President had been the guest of an English
    Monarch,&mdash;an event in itself,&mdash;furthermore, following
    as quickly as it did on the King&rsquo;s successful visit to
    Paris, the arrival of the President in London gave
    proof of the wish of the French nation to live on
    better terms with ourselves, and, indeed, from that
    time onwards, the bitterness and bad feeling between
    the two countries, that arrived at its culminating point
    during the time of the Fashoda incident, may be said
    to have vanished, I hope for ever. In fact, the hatchet
    was buried.</p>
<p>Though contemporary history is not the subject
    with which I am dealing, it is interesting to remember
    that in October of the same year, an arbitration treaty
    was signed by the Governments of England and France,
    and, in the following April, what was known as the
    Anglo-French Agreement, was concluded.</p>
<p>Personally, I was very pleased to have been selected
    to be in attendance on the President. To begin with,
    I like Frenchmen. Monsieur Loubet, though of
    extremely humble origin, was a gentleman. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span> perfect naturalness and simplicity invested him with a
    sort of dignity, that was enhanced by the way in which
    he received every attention and compliment paid him
    during his visit. He never lost an opportunity of
    emphasising the fact that every attention he received,
    was addressed to the &ldquo;President of the French
    Republic,&rdquo; and had nothing to do with &ldquo;Monsieur
    Loubet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another reason I was glad to be of the Mission was
    that it gave me the opportunity of making the acquaintance,
    however slightly, of M. Delcassé, then French
    Minister of Foreign Affairs, who had accompanied the
    President to England. I remember one afternoon,
    when there were some few hours of interval between
    the unending functions, I accompanied M. Delcassé and
    a number of the French gentlemen, on a hurried visit
    they paid to Windsor. It was typical of Frenchmen, and
    of their extraordinary quickness of artistic sense, that
    these very busy public men, who probably had little
    time to study art, at once rushed at all the best of the
    many beautiful things in Windsor. What I had often
    heard of before, was, on that afternoon, brought home to
    me practically, namely, the great admiration the French
    have for the work of Sir Thomas Lawrence. It is true
    that the Lawrences at Windsor are exceptionally fine;
    though I have the profoundest respect for French
    taste, I am not sure that they are right in their inclination
    to prefer Lawrence to Gainsborough and Reynolds,
    in English Art.</p>
<p>I was present at the great State dinner given by the
    King at Buckingham Palace, and a very beautiful sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span> it was. Orchids, and the Windsor gold plate go very
    well together; but far more beautiful, to my mind, are
    those splendid family portraits by the three great
    artists just mentioned, that adorn the walls.</p>
<p>In proposing the toast of the President of the French
    Republic and the French Nation, King Edward, an
    admirable after-dinner speaker, was at his very happiest.
    In the course of his speech he pointed out to the
    President that he was about to drink his health, out of
    the beautiful cup, that had been given him at the Hôtel
    de Ville, during his never-to-be-forgotten, and delightful
    visit to Paris. This little attention might not make
    any great impression on Englishmen, but Frenchmen
    are particularly susceptible to any graceful act or word.
    I happened to be sitting next to M. Mollard, the
    Ministre du Protocol, who always accompanies the
    President on his official journeys. He was genuinely
    delighted and whispered to me:&mdash;&ldquo;Dieu! quel
    homme que votre Roi! Comme il a la parole heureuse,
    et comme il montre de l&rsquo;esprit, et de la finesse!&rdquo;
    And Monsieur Mollard, was no mean judge of that
    important kind of after-dinner speech that is connected
    with official visits. In the course of M. Loubet&rsquo;s
    visit, I once ventured to hope that Monsieur le President
    was not being completely worn out by the strenuous
    days he was living. With a typical Frenchman&rsquo;s shrug
    of the shoulders, he answered, &ldquo;Mon Dieu! Commandant,
    je résiste toujours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the termination of the visit, the English Mission
    accompanied the President and his Staff as far as Dover,
    and there my companions and I took leave of the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span> courteous, and nice old gentleman, that was Monsieur
    Loubet. I was to see him again before very long, for,
    during the semi-private visit that the King and Queen
    paid to Paris a few years later, during which they lived
    at the British Embassy, Monsieur and Madame Loubet,
    then living very simply <i>en bourgeois</i>, after the expiration
    of his term of office as President, came to the Embassy
    to take tea with his late hosts, and former guest.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1903 I was in attendance when the
    King went to Marienbad for a cure, and for the next few
    years I was nearly always there for a portion of August
    and September, sometimes of my own accord, but more
    generally in waiting, and moreover for a succession of
    spring seasons, during his customary visits to Biarritz,
    I was nearly always on duty, at any rate for a part of
    his stay there.</p>
<p>I used greatly to like doing my turn of duty abroad,
    especially at those two very pleasant health resorts, the
    more so as it was evident that his visits to them really
    did King Edward a great deal of good. Like his
    mother, Queen Victoria, before him, he revelled in the
    strong air that can be breathed in mountainous countries
    and at the seaside. Moreover, the waters of Marienbad
    were good without being too strong, and during those
    last years of his life I think he was never better than after
    his Marienbad cure. He had been there once or twice
    as Prince of Wales, but, as far as I can recollect, after he
    came to the Throne, except for the year of his illness
    before his Coronation, I do not think that he ever
    missed a season there, but regarded his annual visit as
    a necessary sequel to the London season.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>
<p>A certain number of English people have always patronised
    Marienbad, notably the late Sir Henry and Lady
    Campbell-Bannerman, and the late Mr. Labouchere.
    Of course, as soon as the King made a practice of going
    there for his cure, quite a number of English people
    suddenly discovered the extraordinarily healing properties
    of these Bohemian Springs, and the little &ldquo;Kur
    Ort&rdquo; became quite as fashionable with English people
    as with foreigners. It really had many good points.
    I cannot speak with any authority on the efficacy of the
    waters from a personal point of view, for I only drank
    them for one season, when the outstanding effect I
    noticed, was, that such little memory as I ever possessed
    vanished entirely, a most inconvenient symptom for an
    Equerry-in-Waiting. During all my subsequent visits
    I contented myself with an &ldquo;air&rdquo; cure, and some parts
    of Marienbad being upwards of 2000 feet above the
    sea-level, the air is of the most approved quality, and
    all meals being taken practically out of doors, and long
    walks forming part of the cure, every one is in the open
    air all day long. After the early morning walk, during
    which time most of the water-drinking was done, the
    whole community, from the King downwards, used to
    eat their solitary egg and drink the best coffee in the
    world, at one of the numerous open-air cafés that lay
    in all directions. After breakfast, there was generally
    more drinking and walking, and three or four times a
    week, some sort of Marienbad bath. Some patients, I
    fancy, wallowed in mud. Personally, I escaped with
    some delightful baths, in which some pine extract was
    mixed up, and most agreeable they were. Then, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span> luncheon, there were delightful walks and drives to be
    taken, to say nothing of golf.</p>

<p>But the golf-course at Marienbad needs further
    mention. To begin with, it owed its very existence to
    King Edward. It was he who &ldquo;squared&rdquo; the authorities,
    from the Abbot of Tepl downwards, to give the
    necessary ground, and, moreover, he gave it his generous
    patronage, by constantly stopping for tea there, on his
    return from his afternoon drives, and in a still more
    practical form, by giving the most beautiful prizes for
    competitors of both sexes.</p>
<p>Having mentioned the Abbot of Tepl, and being on
    the subject of Marienbad amusements, I must go on to
    say a little more about the Religious Community of
    which he is the head, and the sport to be had in the
    neighbourhood, and I feel that I cannot do this better
    than to quote from an Introduction I once wrote for a
    book of the Badminton Series:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;As an amusing specimen of a somewhat peculiar &lsquo;branch&rsquo;
        of the sport in question (the shooting of driven birds), I remember
        well King Edward accepting an invitation from the
        Abbot of Tepl to a partridge-drive on the Tepl estates, which
        surround the famous old Monastery of that name. For those
        who have never &lsquo;made a cure&rsquo; at Marienbad, I must explain
        that the Religious Order in question owns not only the Springs
        and Baths of Marienbad, but also a vast tract of agricultural
        land, which is farmed by the monks and their tenants. The
        Abbot himself is a great dignitary of the Roman Catholic
        Church; he has a seat in the Austrian House of Lords, and his
        principal duty is to administer the vast properties belonging to
        the Monastery, which has existed without intermission from
        the thirteenth century to our own time.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Bohemia in general, and the Böhmischer Wald,&mdash;above
        which Marienbad is situated,&mdash;in particular, is famous for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span> partridges; but driving them was a new form of sport as far
        as the monks themselves were concerned. It had been their
        practice from time immemorial to have them shot by any
        obliging man who happened to own a gun, for the purpose of
        supplying their table. However, for so distinguished a guest as
        King Edward an exception had to be made, so the Abbot, with
        the assistance of a travelling Englishman, arranged a partridge-drive
        on the most approved pattern. The performance began
        with a Gargantuan luncheon in the refectory of the Monastery,
        at which repast the whole of the King&rsquo;s party, which included
        several ladies, was present. So long was the bill of fare, and,
        it may be added, so excellent were its items, that it was well
        past two in the afternoon before the guns were posted. On
        arriving at the butts, which had been beautifully constructed
        for the occasion, it was evident that the services of the whole
        population of the neighbourhood for miles round had been
        called into requisition. Those employed as drivers and flankers
        were under the immediate command of some of the more
        venerable members of the fraternity; those who came as
        spectators, unfortunately for the bag, wandered about at their
        own sweet will. The Abbot himself, in a very short shooting-coat
        over his white cassock, a most rakish wide-awake hat on
        his head, and an enormous cigar in his mouth, took up a commanding
        position in the King&rsquo;s butt, various horns sounded,
        and the fun began. Partridges there were in plenty; but,
        unfortunately, the monks had felt inspired to fly two gigantic
        kites, with the laudable desire of concentrating the birds and
        driving them over the King&rsquo;s butt. The desired result of
        concentration was undoubtedly obtained, but the general effect
        of the kites was to cause the birds to run down the furrows instead of flying over the guns, and this, combined with the
        intense caution and self-restraint that had to be exercised by
        the shooters, in order to avoid hitting either a flanker, or one
        of the numerous spectators before alluded to, resulted in a
        remarkably small bag. However, it was all excellent fun, and
        no one was more amused at the incongruity of the whole <i>chasse</i>, than the King himself.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Shortly afterwards King Edward had a very different
        experience in the same neighbourhood, when partridge-driving
        with Count Trautmansdorff. In a short day&rsquo;s shooting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span> party bagged 500 brace of partridge, the King himself accounting
        for 100 brace to his own gun. Though it hardly comes
        under the province of sport, perhaps I may be permitted to
        mention that the following winter Count Trautmansdorff was
        one of the guests at Sandringham during the best shooting
        week there, and also that not long afterwards the Abbot of
        Tepl was invited to Windsor, and found himself being taken
        round the Castle and shown its treasures by the King himself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another distraction at Marienbad was the comparative
    proximity of Karlsbad. Karlsbad was by way of
    being far gayer, and more fashionable, than its humbler
    neighbour, and certainly the hotels and shops were
    on a more luxurious scale. The King generally went
    over there for the day, once or twice in the season.
    One of the constant Cure guests there in those days,
    used to be Monsieur Clemenceau, and, as a general
    rule, the late Grand Duke Alexis, and several other
    members of the Imperial Family, were to be found
    at Karlsbad. Indeed, it was greatly patronised by
    Russians in general.</p>
<p>On looking back on those seasons at Marienbad, it
    is curious to remember what a kaleidoscope of people
    of all countries, and some of considerable distinction,
    are associated with the place. To begin with, in early
    times there were Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman,
    Mr. Henry Labouchere, and Miss Maxine Elliott&mdash;I
    was going to write, then at the height of her beauty,
    but she is always beautiful&mdash;her sister, Lady Forbes
    Robertson, in those days, if I may dare use the expression,
    a flapper. Another marvellously beautiful woman,
    Princess Mirko of Montenegro, was there for a
    season with her husband, who was one of the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span> progeny of the old Prince Nicholas of that curious little
    principality. Prince Mirko died (so I heard) in Vienna,
    having disowned his country, during the War. The
    lady in question was, I believe, the daughter of some
    Serbian General, and was certainly one of the most
    lovely women I have ever met in my life. Another
    constant visitor was that remarkably astute, and still
    more remarkably antipathetic personage, who was then
    Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria. The late Prince Kinsky,
    Slatin Pasha, and Count Tassito Festitics, with his
    wife and daughter, were occasional visitors; Count
    Szapary was another Hungarian who occasionally
    indulged in a cure, and on one occasion he arrived
    at Marienbad with his own Tzigane band, so one
    night, after dining at a restaurant, he gave us a regular
    concert, conducting his band himself on the cymballen.
    Amongst the more regular visitors were a host of
    friends of mine, such as Sir Charles Mathews, Mr.
    Charles Gill, and Mr. Charles Hawtrey, the latter,
    mimicking his doctor, the celebrated Dr. Ott, to his
    (perfectly unconscious) face, was as good as he ever
    was, on any stage.</p>
<p>Other friends who were apt to do a Marienbad
    Season were, the late General Sir Lawrence Oliphant,
    one of the most amusing and quick-witted of men,
    Mr. Henry Chaplin, Colonel Mark Lockwood, and
    Sir John Fisher&mdash;now known respectively as Lords
    Chaplin, Lambourne, and Fisher; then amongst well-known
    Parisians I may quote Princesse Murat, the
    Marquise de Ganay, Comtesse de Chevigné, M. and
    Madame Jean de Reszke, Count Boni de Castellane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span> and Count Joseph de Gontaut-Biron, and I must not
    forget the British Ambassadors at Vienna, Sir Edward
    Goschen and Sir Fairfax Cartwright, who invariably
    settled down at Marienbad during the King&rsquo;s stay
    there, accompanied by one or two Secretaries of their
    Embassy.</p>
<p>In the course of his earlier visits, the King generally
    went over once or twice in the Season to the seat of
    the late Count Metternich. Metternichs of sorts used
    to, and I suppose still, swarm in both Germany and
    Austria; but this particular Metternich was the direct
    descendant of the great man of that name who flourished
    during the Napoleonic era. Amongst his other properties
    was the celebrated Johannisberg Vineyard on the Rhine,
    and I must say, that a glass or two of real Johannisberg
    Cabinet of one of the great vintage years, at luncheon
    made a man take a very roseate view of life, even of
    that dullest of so-called sports,&mdash;a deer-drive in the
    woods, which generally used to follow the Metternich
    luncheon parties.</p>
<p>An annual fête that was regularly celebrated at
    Marienbad during King Edward&rsquo;s sojourn there, was
    the birthday of the late Emperor Franz Josef of Austria.
    The King made a practice of entertaining the various
    officials of the neighbourhood, in honour of the occasion.
    The guests consisted mainly of the officers commanding
    the troops of the district, any <i>hoch geboren</i> Austrians
    who might happen to be there, the principal municipal
    authorities, and last, but by no means least, our friend
    the Abbot of Tepl.</p>
<p>Almost the pleasantest memory of Marienbad that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span> remains to me, is that, of our breakfasts under the trees
    at one of the outdoor cafés, where a number of us met
    after the morning drink. Sir Edward Goschen, Colonel
    Mark Lockwood, Mr. Charles Gill, Mr. Charles
    Hawtrey, and generally about the same number of
    ladies, used to assemble round, what was really a very
    festive board, and consume coffee and eggs with the
    appetite that follows a two-hours&rsquo; walk in keen
    mountain air, and the good spirits engendered by the
    consciousness, that the greater part of the water-drinking
    business was over for the day.</p>
<p>As I have already mentioned, I was generally in
    attendance on the late King during, anyhow, a portion
    of his yearly stay at Biarritz, and, being very fond of
    the little place, I have also frequented it a good deal
    when not on duty. Biarritz was eminently social, as not
    only were there a good many charming villas in the
    neighbourhood, owned by French residents, but in
    what was called the English Season, English visitors
    abounded. A great deal of entertaining was done
    first and last, principally by my previously mentioned
    friend, Consuelo Duchess of Manchester,
    who often took a villa there, and also by an extraordinarily
    hospitable American lady, who, I regret to
    say, died not long ago, Mrs. Moore by name. She
    had practically lived in France all her life, and her
    apartment in Paris had always a lighted candle, for she
    loved entertaining, and was an excellent hostess. She
    talked the most impossible French, with a strong
    American accent, and mixed her metaphors to such an
    extent that she became a sort of Mrs. Malaprop, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span> the huge delight of her French friends. I never quite
    believed in the authenticity of the numerous malapropisms
    for which she was made responsible; I verily
    believe that she could speak French extremely well,
    and that she really was only amusing herself, when she
    spoke in the extraordinary jargon that she affected.
    Anyhow, her parties were the greatest fun, and not
    only all Biarritz, but all Paris went to them.</p>
<p>The King was very fond of making excursions by
    motor-car after he had finished off his morning business,
    and lovely drives could be taken to St. Sebastian,
    Fuentarabia, and in the Pyrenees. On one occasion
    he motored over, with a large party of friends, to Pau,
    to see what was then the greatest wonder of the age,
    namely, Mr. Wilbur Wright and his brother actually
    flying in the air.</p>
<p>But as far as I was personally concerned when not
    on duty there, my greatest amusement was to play golf
    on that sporting little course, part of which lies on top
    of the cliffs, and part at their feet, close to the sea.
    There was also a pack of fox-hounds, but if anybody
    was keen about hunting, and could not manage to hunt
    in England, Pau was, on the whole, infinitely preferable
    to Biarritz, as there was much less woodland, and in
    some parts quite a fine grass country. For the fortunate
    people who always winter away from England, and
    are fond of creature comforts and easy journeys, there
    is nothing like the South of France; the difficulty
    was to choose between the two French Departments,
    the Alpes-Maritimes and the Basses-Pyrénées. I have
    listened to endless arguments as to their respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span> merits, and, as usual, there is a great deal to be said
    on both sides.</p>
<p>Both at Pau and Biarritz there was a great deal of
    very fair sport to be obtained, as between them they
    could produce two packs of fox-hounds, a certain
    amount of wild shooting, excellent fishing, for in some
    of the valleys in the neighbourhood of Pau there are
    first-class trout streams, and some good salmon are to
    be taken occasionally. Moreover, both towns rejoice
    in a Club, that of Pau being one of the most comfortable
    establishments of the sort I have ever come across,
    and there is plenty of golf. But, mild as is the climate,
    it is, nevertheless, a grey Northern winter. On the
    Riviera, it is the genuine South, with its brilliant sunshine
    and colour, and masses of flowers, and, moreover,
    that general air of gaiety that seems to spring naturally
    from sunshine and colour. Then, again, the Riviera
    is wonderfully beautiful. A stroll round the promontory
    of Monaco on a fine morning at Christmas
    time, is one of the most satisfactory promenades in the
    world, and there were few pleasanter places than Monte
    Carlo until it became spoiled, as Venice and Florence,
    and, indeed, as all the pleasantest and most beautiful
    places in the world were, in recent years, by the
    invasion of that most atrocious sample, of a very odious
    race,&mdash;I mean the low-class German tourist. Swarms
    of these detestable people used to be let loose in
    Monte Carlo, arriving in cheap trains from Germany,
    and spoiling everything by their horrible manners, and
    general shoddiness. The normal population of Monte
    Carlo may have consisted of scamps, male and female,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span> but, at any rate, until the wholesale arrival of the
    Germans they were well-mannered and well-dressed
    scamps, and were not eyesores to the surrounding
    scenery.</p>
<p>There have always been numerous legendary suicides
    connected with Monte Carlo. In old days, these
    scandals used to be freely invented by some of the
    local newspapers, until a decent subsidy was obtained
    from the Casino Company, when they invariably and
    unaccountably (?) ceased. I do not suppose that in
    reality there have been more suicides at Monte Carlo
    than in any other place where there is a constantly
    shifting and cosmopolitan population, but, oddly
    enough, I witnessed one once, and without any particular
    feeling of regret. There had been a particularly
    vile specimen of the German tourist, playing a very
    small game at a table I had been patronising in the
    afternoon, who made himself odious to every one in
    his vicinity by his noise and bad manners. That evening,
    I happened to be dining early and alone in the
    Restaurant of the Hôtel de Paris before going to the
    Opera. I had just begun my dinner, and was seated
    close to the windows that look out on the Rond Point,
    just outside the steps of the Casino. It was about the
    hour that most people would be dressing for dinner,
    so the little &ldquo;Place&rdquo; was quite deserted. Suddenly
    I saw a figure come hurrying down the steps, and
    when it reached the Rond Point I recognised the man
    who had made himself so objectionable in the rooms
    during the afternoon. Just as he arrived opposite the
    window he produced a revolver and shot himself. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span> then what interested me, was the intervention of the
    Police. The &ldquo;Place,&rdquo; which before had seemed quite
    deserted, swarmed with them; they appeared to come
    out of the ground. In a trice the suicide,&mdash;for the man,
    I am sure, was dead,&mdash;was seated in a victoria, with an
    agent de police by his side, and driven rapidly away.
    The last I saw was Monsieur l&rsquo;Agent putting the man&rsquo;s
    hat on with a sort of fatherly air, as if saying, &ldquo;It is
    all right; you are not the least hurt, only a little
    frightened.&rdquo; The local newspaper subsidies must have
    been in full blast just then, for I never heard nor read
    any mention of the incident.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>
<h3>SOME RECOLLECTIONS OF AN EQUERRY</h3>
<p>To return to Marienbad: on the 31st of August,
    his cure having been completed, the King paid a visit
    to the Emperor Franz Josef at Vienna, and was
    lodged with his suite at the Hofburg. I have written
    so much about official visits in the last two chapters,
    that I do not think it the least necessary to enlarge
    on the Vienna visit. There was a Court representation
    at the Opera one evening and a dinner at the
    Palace of Schönbrunn, followed by a Court performance
    at the Burg Theatre. The Emperor himself was
    an interesting personage, in a sense, and though I
    believe not in the least remarkable for brains or intelligence,
    he will be remembered in history as having
    succeeded in keeping together the heterogeneous
    bevy ofNationalities, that was known as the Austro-Hungarian
    Empire, during a very long reign. He
    was often described as a sort of Royal Martyr, owing
    to the succession of tragedies that occurred in his
    family; but those who knew him best, always said
    that these tragedies that shocked the world, left him
    perfectly unmoved, so completely selfish and self-centred
    was he. Great capital was made out of his
    industry, and the fact that he rose at five in the
    morning, but in reality there was nothing particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span> remarkable about this early rising (except for the
    appalling inconvenience it was to his suite and servants),
    for he dined at five in the afternoon and went
    to bed at eight. Eight hours cannot be looked upon
    as a very short night&rsquo;s rest. Latterly, I believe, he
    lived almost entirely at Schönbrunn, and in his old
    age used to breakfast daily with an aged actress who
    had been a friend of his in old days, and was established
    in a villa close to the palace. There was,
    naturally, at their age, no concealment about what
    had become a very harmless liaison, and the whole
    Viennese public were perfectly aware of it.</p>
<p>I was not enormously impressed with Schönbrunn.
    The most noticeable feature there, to my mind, was
    the mounting of two guards of honour outside the
    Emperor&rsquo;s apartments, when the King and his suite
    arrived to dine there. On one side of the corridor
    the guard was Austrian, and opposite were posted a
    similar number of Hungarian troops, both guards
    looking as if nothing would please them so much as
    to fly at each other&rsquo;s throats. I had visited Vienna
    before on my way home from Galatz, and knew the
    town pretty well, but was not then made an Honorary
    Member of the Jockey Club, as we all were in 1903.
    It was a most agreeable Club, and admirably managed.
    Amongst other details, the Club had a large permanent
    box at the Opera, which any member could use
    at his discretion.</p>
<p>The visit lasted the usual three or four days, and
    so the King and his suite were back in England in
    excellent time for the Doncaster races.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>
<p>In October I was again on duty, spending most of
    the time between London and Newmarket, and was in
    attendance on the 9th of that month when the change
    of Government took place. There is an immemorial
    custom on those occasions that the outgoing and incoming
    Ministers do not meet; they are carefully
    shepherded into separate apartments. I remember, even
    to this day, my delight and amusement in watching
    the performance of one of the noted political wire-pullers
    of that period. I never quite grasped why he
    should have been at the palace at all on that occasion,
    but there he was, and, characteristically, going
    constantly in and out of <i>both</i> rooms!</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>The year 1904 was a busy year, as far as my duties
    were concerned, for I was in attendance when the
    King and Queen and Princess Victoria paid a three
    weeks&rsquo; visit to Copenhagen. The Royal Yacht conveyed
    the whole party as far as Flushing, the rest of
    the journey being done by the train, which was put
    bodily on board the ferry between Nyborg and Korson,
    the distance across being about equal to our Channel
    route between Dover and Calais.</p>
<p>The first two or three days of the visit were decidedly
    official, but after the usual ceremonial in the
    shape of gala dinners, etc., had been got through,
    the Royal Family were living very simply with their
    relations, Queen Alexandra, of course, being delighted
    to revisit her old home in her comparatively new
    capacity as Queen. It was a fairly full family circle,
    as Prince and Princess Charles, now King and Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span> of Norway, were living in their apartment close to the
    Amalienborg Palace, in two different portions of which
    the two monarchs were lodged.</p>
<p>The Amalienborg Palace certainly deserves more
    attention than it generally receives; the proportions
    of the &ldquo;Plads&rdquo; that are formed by the four uniform
    buildings that enclose the &ldquo;Plads&rdquo; and are the
    Palace, make up, altogether, one of the most perfect
    architectural sites that I know in Europe. I have often
    heard it compared to the Place Vendôme, but, to my
    mind, though smaller, it is even handsomer, with its
    four mid-eighteenth century buildings at the four
    corners of the octagon, and the equestrian monument
    of Frederick V, of the same date, in its centre.</p>
<p>The Society in Copenhagen is naturally limited, as
    it is a comparatively small capital; but in those days,
    when it was constantly visited by the numerous and
    extremely influential relations of the then King Christian,
    to be Minister there was looked upon by representatives
    of the great Continental Powers, as a sure
    stepping-stone towards the highest diplomatic posts.
    In my time there I can remember such men as the
    late Count Benckendorff, M. Isvolsky, M. Crozier,
    as respectively Russian and French Ministers at Copenhagen.
    In 1904 that very charming house, the British
    Legation, was tenanted by two great friends of mine,
    Sir Alan and Lady Johnstone. They were both
    immensely popular in Copenhagen Society, and entertained
    most hospitably and gave the pleasantest of
    dinners. The Opera, too, was a great distraction,
    some of the performances being very well given, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span> ballets, in particular, being quite first-rate. Altogether,
    the time there passed very agreeably.</p>
<p>By the middle of April the King and Queen were
    back at Buckingham Palace, but for a short time, for,
    before the end of the month, they had crossed from
    Holyhead to Kingstown, on a short visit to Ireland.
    Two or three days were spent at the Viceregal Lodge,
    Dublin, as the guests of Lord and Lady Dudley, the
    then Viceroy and Vicereine, during which the King
    laid the foundation-stone of the Royal College of
    Science in Dublin, with the usual formalities, and saw
    some good racing at Punchestown and in the Ph&#339;nix
    Park. In the course of the short tour that had been
    arranged, their Majesties visited Kilkenny, where they
    stayed for a couple of nights as the guests of the late
    Marquis of Ormonde and Lady Ormonde, and also
    paid a similar visit to the late Duke and Duchess of
    Devonshire at Lismore.</p>
<p>Lismore is very beautiful. The Castle itself is not
    a very genuine specimen of a castle, but it is so
    perfectly situated on some high ground on the banks
    of the Blackwater, that it looks most imposing, and the
    view from the windows, looking up and down the
    river, is quite lovely. During the stay of the Royal
    party, great dinners were given at the Castle, to which
    numbers of the gentry of the neighbourhood were
    invited. There is a fine dining-hall at the Castle, so
    the dinners were veritably banquets. By way of
    thoroughly carrying out the banquet scheme, the host
    and hostess&mdash;neither of whom cared in the least for
    music&mdash;had engaged the services of the band of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span> local Militia Regiment, which was very correctly
    stationed in the gallery. Never have I heard such
    appalling sounds as proceeded from that gallery; but,
    none the less, the Bandmaster was thoroughly enjoying
    himself, and conducted, much to his own satisfaction, a
    lengthy programme of the noisiest and most discordant
    music (?) from which I have ever suffered.</p>
<p>Talking of being at Lismore reminds me of the
    many times, and the many different places, in which I
    have been a guest of those two most hospitable people,
    the late Duke and Duchess of Devonshire. Probably
    no two people ever entertained to the extent that they
    did. At Chatsworth, in the winter, there were almost
    incessant large parties for the Derby November Race
    Meeting, which they always attended, and where the
    Duke always ran some horses; until past the New
    Year. They were at Lismore, generally, for three
    weeks in the spring, during which time, besides having
    friends to stay with them, the whole countryside was
    entertained at dinner. Then, at that charming place
    just outside Eastbourne, Compton Place, all through
    the summer they had a constant flow of visitors staying
    there for Sundays. At Newmarket, their little house
    in the High Street was always full for the Race
    Meetings, and, finally, what perhaps the Duke enjoyed
    most of all, there were the weeks spent at Bolton
    Abbey, from which, he and his guests daily cantered
    away on their ponies to shoot grouse on those famous
    moors. All of these houses were delightful to stay in,
    but I think, on the whole, I preferred my visits to
    Chatsworth, which was a veritable museum of beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span> things. The greater part of the wonderful collection
    there was formed by the sixth Duke, who was known in
    his time as the &ldquo;Magnifico.&rdquo; In reality, as regards art,
    he was less of a Patron and more of a Collector than the
    Medicean Potentate with whom he shared the appellation.
    The result, as seen at Chatsworth, eminently
    justified what must have been a combination of connoisseurship,
    good advice, and great wealth. Besides
    the family pictures, amongst which is that lovely
    Sir Joshua of the beautiful Duchess playing &ldquo;hot
    codlins&rdquo; with her baby daughter, there is a gallery of
    collected pictures amongst which there are some real
    treasures, such as the famous Van Eyck triptych.
    There is also a sculpture gallery containing some of
    the best work of Canova and Thorwalsden. Personally
    I do not greatly care for the work of either of these
    masters, but none the less the examples at Chatsworth
    were very good of their kind. Then the library was
    wonderful, containing as it did endless treasures, such
    as volumes of Van Dyck&rsquo;s original drawings, the
    unique <i>Liber Veritatis</i> of Claude Lorraine, and, in
    addition, some beautiful illuminated missals and fine
    bindings. Finally, what appealed to me most of all,
    was the collection of drawings of the great Italian
    masters which, simply framed, were hung in a long well-lighted
    gallery where they could really be seen and
    studied in comfort.</p>
<p>So much&mdash;or, more correctly, so little&mdash;about the
    interior of Chatsworth, except a passing mention of
    the number of pleasant people of all sorts that made
    up the parties there. Outside the house, the gardens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span> and shrubberies were on a magnificent scale: in the
    midst of the latter stood the miniature Crystal Palace,
    used as a palm and fern house, erected by Sir Joseph
    Paxton. The best of covert shooting, (for nowhere can
    high pheasants be better shown than on the steep-wooded
    hillsides of Derbyshire,) an excellent grouse
    moor on the high ground above the house, and an
    eighteen-hole golf-course in the park, combined to make
    up a really magnificent English home of the sort that
    is so rapidly disappearing, and that probably in another
    generation will have ceased to exist.</p>
<p>It used to be rather the fashion in those days to
    talk as if the Duke was only busily engaged in politics
    because greatness in that line had been thrust upon
    him, and because, from a keen sense of duty, he felt
    obliged to play his part as a constant Minister of the
    Crown. To my mind, this was an absolutely false
    conception of the man. I believe that, fond as he was
    of sport, and also of being surrounded by younger
    people, nevertheless, the constant love of his life was
    politics.</p>
<p>Talking of his liking for younger people, there was a
    famous story about him years ago at Newmarket. One
    of his guests had heard him returning to the house in
    the small hours, and at breakfast next morning asked
    him what had kept him up so late. He replied that
    he had been playing whist at the Jockey Club Rooms
    with some young men whose names he did not know.
    &ldquo;They called each other,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;&lsquo;Putty,&rsquo; &lsquo;Tops,&rsquo;
    and the &lsquo;Shaver,&rsquo; and had it not been that the
    &lsquo;Shaver&rsquo; had to attend a prize fight at six in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span> morning, I probably should have been playing whist
    there still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But to return to the Duke as a politician. Though
    I have heard him groan at having to prepare a speech
    when he might otherwise have been out shooting with
    his guests, and probably be rather bored when he had
    to deliver it; yet, none the less, I think that he enjoyed
    the satisfaction of knowing that his closely-reasoned
    utterances would be read in the Press next morning by
    thousands of his countrymen, who, on any important
    subject, were always glad to study the opinion of one
    of the wisest, and most perfectly honest of Englishmen.
    In his last years his position in this country was very
    remarkable. The public, in spite of the attractions of
    those who might possibly be described as &ldquo;Headline
    Politicians,&rdquo; have a great respect and belief in a man
    whom they know instinctively, as well as by reputation,
    to be honest, truthful, and absolutely disinterested.
    The cynical might remark that it is easy for a man
    with the late Duke&rsquo;s position and possessions, to be the
    reverse of self-seeking, but I think those who knew
    him best will agree with me, that whatever had been
    his position, his character would have been the same.</p>
<p>In November 1904 I was in attendance on King
    Carlos of Portugal, when His Majesty and Queen
    Amelie arrived in England to return the King&rsquo;s visit
    to Lisbon of the previous year.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the official visit King Carlos
    remained for some weeks in England, which he spent
    principally in paying a series of visits to various
    country houses for shooting, about which sport he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span> extremely keen. He was a very fine shot, and for that
    reason alone would have been a welcome guest at any
    shooting party. He visited in succession Didlington
    Hall, then in the possession of the late Lord Amherst
    of Hackney; Elveden Hall, Lord Iveagh&rsquo;s wonderful
    shooting manor, once tenanted by another great shot,
    the late Maharajah Duleep Singh; Bowood, Lord
    Lansdowne&rsquo;s beautiful seat in Wiltshire, and finally
    Chatsworth. It was a bitterly cold winter, and both
    at Elveden and Chatsworth there was deep snow on
    the ground. I have never met a man so completely
    impervious to cold as was the late King of Portugal.
    He would stand outside a cover in a bitter wind with
    nothing on but the thinnest of shooting coats, as he
    found that thick clothes hampered his quickness with
    the gun, which was really very remarkable; he was not
    only very accurate as a shot, but quick,&mdash;phenomenally
    quick,&mdash;in getting on to his bird.</p>
<p>During the whole of this tour, the Marquis de
    Soveral, Lord Suffield and I were in attendance. It was
    an extremely pleasant round of visits, and the shooting
    at all of them was very good,&mdash;at Elveden, of course,
    particularly so. Queen Amelie had, meanwhile, been
    paying some visits on her own account; but she accompanied
    the King to Chatsworth, which was the last
    private visit he paid before returning to the Continent.
    King Carlos was the personification of good nature and
    kindness, and was also an extremely accomplished man,
    which made his brutal murder in the streets of Lisbon
    on February 2nd, 1908, seem to any of those who had
    the honour of knowing him personally, to be not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span> one of the foulest, but also one of the most meaningless
    murders in history.</p>
<p>Before the year 1904 ended, I was to take part in
    yet one more official visit, having been detailed to be
    in attendance on H.R.H. Prince Arthur of Connaught,
    when representing the King at the christening of the
    infant son and heir of the King and Queen of Italy.
    Prince Arthur and his suite, consisting of Field-Marshal
    Lord Grenfell, Captain Windham, then one of
    the Duke of Connaught&rsquo;s Equerries, and myself, duly
    arrived in Rome during the first days of December.
    The actual christening took place in one of the
    drawing-rooms of the Quirinal Palace. It really was
    rather a pretty sight. A temporary altar had been set up,
    there was a procession of the Royal Families and their
    Representatives, headed by a bevy of priests, with a
    band in the gallery playing suitable music.</p>
<p>When the ceremony was over there was an enormous
    luncheon, followed in the evening by a gala dinner.
    In a letter which I wrote home at the time, it is evident
    that I was much impressed with the beauty of the
    jewels worn by some of the ladies at the banquet!
    &ldquo;Some of the women certainly had on the most
    marvellous jewels; there was one opposite me, whose
    name I cannot remember, who wore such diamonds as I
    doubt if I ever saw before, even on Royalties. Donna
    Franca Florio (one of the most beautiful women of her
    time) was beautifully dressed, and had on a long row
    of splendid pearls that reached to her knees. She
    looked very handsome, as also did Princess Teano.
    But the beauty of the jewels that were worn impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span> me greatly. Some of them looked as if they  must
    have been heirlooms dating from the Renaissance.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>During all these years, some events of which I have
    been endeavouring to describe, notwithstanding a good
    deal of duty, much of which entailed being out of the
    country, I was by no means neglecting racing&mdash;a sport
    to which, in those days, I was very devoted. To go
    racing meant being amongst almost the pleasantest of
    one&rsquo;s friends, and amidst the cheeriest of surroundings,
    and, in addition, it became more interesting to me owing
    to the large increase in the size of the Sandringham
    Stud. The bloodstock in the paddocks there had been
    largely augmented in the way of brood mares by the
    purchase, amongst others, of such fine animals as
    Laodamia and Nonsuch, the natural result being that
    every year there were more foals and yearlings to
    inspect, and prophesy about. But racing is a curiously
    fluctuating business, and, unfortunately, beautiful as
    these young things were to look at, from 1901 onwards
    they turned out, with hardly an exception, to be singularly
    worthless. After Diamond Jubilee&rsquo;s great year of
    1900, for a long spell, Richard Marsh was hardly able
    to win a race for his leading patron. For the entire racing
    season of 1901, during which time the King was in
    mourning for Queen Victoria, the race-horses were
    leased to the Duke of Devonshire (another of Marsh&rsquo;s
    patrons) and ran in his colours. Great things were
    expected of them. To begin with, Diamond Jubilee
    seemed to have the three races, open to four-year-olds,
    at his mercy, but he was a queer-tempered animal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span> declined altogether to exert himself any further, and
    though he ran in succession in the Princess of Wales,
    the Eclipse, and Jockey Club Stakes, the St. Leger of
    1900 was his last victory. Lean year followed lean
    year, and it was not until 1908, when the Sandringham
    Stud could only send up one colt seemingly worthy of
    training, that the luck began to turn. To make up for
    this shortage of colts, the King leased half a dozen
    two-year-old colts from Colonel Hall Walker (who has
    lately become Lord Wavertree) and partly thanks to
    Minoru, one of the leased animals, but mainly to the
    home-bred Princesse de Galles, who won five nice races,
    there was at last a respectable winning balance in the
    way of stakes.</p>
<p>But 1908 was easily eclipsed by the season of 1909,
    when the King was placed at the head of the winning
    list of owners. This was mainly owing to the success
    of Minoru, who won five good races in succession,
    including the two classics,&mdash;namely the Two Thousand
    and the Derby. The King&rsquo;s Derby victory was
    acclaimed with wonderful enthusiasm by the immense
    crowd at Epsom; His Majesty followed the tradition
    of leading in his horse, but how he managed to get on
    to the course, inundated as it was with a surging crowd
    of enthusiasts, and, having got there, how he ever got
    inside the neighbouring enclosure again, is almost past
    the wit of man to understand. However, supported
    by Lord Marcus Beresford, Marsh, and an Equerry or
    two, to say nothing of the still more efficient aid of
    two or three men of the Metropolitan Police, the
    impossible was duly performed, and Minoru was led in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span> I was not at Epsom when Diamond Jubilee won the
    Derby, but I saw Persimmon win, so knew something
    of the cheering of which an Epsom crowd is capable,
    but even then it was nothing to the delight displayed
    by the crowd, when the Derby was won by their own
    reigning Sovereign.</p>
<p>One other occasion I remember at Epsom, when the
    crowd was wonderfully pleased and enthusiastic, and
    that was when Signorinetta had won the Oaks for the
    Cavaliere Ginistrelli, having scored the double event
    by winning the Derby two days before. The King
    and Queen Alexandra were present in the Royal box,
    and I happened to be in waiting at the time. As soon
    as the mare&rsquo;s number had gone up I was dispatched to
    find the Cavaliere, and inform him that the King
    wished to congratulate him personally on his dual
    victory. With great difficulty I succeeded in getting
    him to accompany me to the Royal box, (so shy and
    confused was he at the sudden honour that was to be
    thrust on him), but I eventually succeeded. On his
    arrival in the Royal box, the King placed him in the
    front of it between the Queen and himself, so that he
    could bow his acknowledgments to the cheering crowd.
    The crowd was delighted, for he was a very popular
    man in the racing world, especially at Newmarket,
    where he lived, and though the crowd on Oaks day is
    very much smaller than it is on the day of the Derby,
    the cheering was, nevertheless, terrific in its intensity.</p>
<p>But my racing recollections are getting far in
    advance of their time, and I must revert to a few
    years earlier and get on with my story.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>
<h3>MORE RECOLLECTIONS OF AN EQUERRY</h3>
<p>In 1906 I came in for a most interesting cruise in
    the Royal Yacht, which took me further afield than I
    had been for many a long year, for early in April the
    King and Queen and Princess Victoria joined the Royal
    Yacht at Marseilles for a cruise in Eastern waters.</p>
<p>The voyage cannot be said to have commenced
    auspiciously, as the yacht was compelled to remain for
    four days at Marseilles, whilst weatherbound by an
    atrocious gale. However, nothing lasts for ever, and
    eventually the gale came to an end, so by the 8th of
    the month the yacht was on her way to Messina, at
    which port she arrived early next day. Taormina, the
    beautiful, being within easy reach, had, of course, to be
    visited. It was always a pleasure to me to see it again;
    but I knew the place well, having been there in the old <i>Surprise</i> days, and later, in the course of a winter trip
    to Sicily.</p>
<p>From Messina it was only a short journey to Corfu,
    and there the Royal Yacht was to spend some days not
    only in very beautiful, but also amongst very interesting
    surroundings. To commence with, the King of
    the Hellenes was there with a number of his family on
    board his yacht the <i>Amphitrite</i>; the Prince and Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span> of Wales, on their way home from India, were on board
    the <i>Renown</i>; and, finally, the Mediterranean Fleet was
    at anchor in the bay under the command of the late
    Lord Beresford, flying his flag from the masthead of
    H.M.S. <i>Bulwark</i>.</p>
<p>Various entertainments were given on board the
    flagship in the shape of dinners, and we were also
    shown a good deal of what was then the new Navy,
    for even as late as 1906 the Fleet in the Mediterranean
    was our most up-to-date Naval asset, and its command
    was still looked upon as the most important in the Navy.
    Except for the great beauty of the island itself, there
    is nothing very remarkable in the way of sight-seeing
    to be done at Corfu, so in default of any other short
    excursion, the Achilleion was frequently visited; the
    house itself consists of a sort of rather tawdry villa,
    built in what is evidently meant to be a Pompeian style,
    the whole edifice being extremely ugly and characteristically
    German in taste. But there criticism ends, for
    as regards situation, and the view from the garden, it is
    absolutely beautiful. From where the statue of Achilles
    stands, from which the villa takes its name, one can see
    right over the little town of Corfu, with its charming
    old Venetian fort, and Ulysses&rsquo; Island, enshrined in a
    most beautiful bay, the whole view being rounded off
    by a background, consisting of the mountains of Albania.</p>
<p>In fact, Corfu is a very charming place, and I always
    wonder that more people do not winter there; it has
    a delightful climate, the scenery is superb, the roads
    we made during our long occupation of the island,
    although sadly neglected by their present owners, make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span> excursions in all directions still feasible. On the other
    hand, islands are always troublesome to arrive at, and
    get away from, and there is no such thing as a Casino
    there, though were it to become a fashionable winter
    resort, that necessity (?) would doubtless be soon provided
    by some enterprising Greek syndicate.</p>
<p>After four or five pleasant days at Corfu, the <i>Victoria
    and Albert</i> proceeded to the Piræus, and on her arrival
    there, the King and Queen and Princess Victoria and
    the suite left Piræus for Athens, and took up their
    temporary residence at the palace.</p>
<p>Shortly after our King&rsquo;s arrival, the Olympic games,
    that were intended to be a sort of International Sporting
    Tournament, to be held in turn in various Capitals,
    were inaugurated in the new Stadium that had been
    built for the occasion. The Stadium, in another thousand
    years or so, when the white marble of which it is
    built has become coloured and patinaed with age, may
    become beautiful; but to my mind, nothing is so
    hideous as the staring white, of brand-new marble, and
    the Stadium at Athens was no exception. It was of
    huge size, and being new, could look like nothing in the
    world but a wedding cake. Personally, I am not fond
    of looking on at what are called &ldquo;sports,&rdquo; especially
    when they consist largely in teams of extremely well-drilled
    and well-set-up athletes doing, what used to be
    called in the Navy &ldquo;physical drill,&rdquo; and a large part of
    the competition seemed made up of these exercises,
    which are, I fancy, very popular in Germany and among
    the Northern races generally. But one very interesting
    competition I did see, that took place outside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span> Stadium in a garden in the vicinity; for there the
    English team of épéeists (if there is such a word!)
    encountered the German representatives, and to our
    great joy soundly trounced them. Our team was
    headed by Lord Desborough, and eventually fought its
    way into the final, in which they were defeated, after a
    very close contest, I think, by the Belgians. The
    particular bout that delighted me, was one between
    Lord Desborough, and a remarkably corpulent German
    expert, who received such a prodding from his powerful
    and active antagonist that, in spite of the plastron
    and the button on the épée, I fully expected to see
    daylight let into the Teutonic &ldquo;corpulency&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Towards the end of the month, the Royal Yacht was
    once more under weigh, anchoring for a night at
    Katakolo to enable a visit to be paid to Olympia. I
    had been several times to Athens before, but never had
    managed to get to Olympia, which is really very difficult
    of access. To get there in any comfort a yacht is
    required, supplemented by a short railway journey and
    a long drive, and as the hotel&mdash;or rather the village
    inn&mdash;is quite remarkably bad, the whole expedition has
    to be compressed into the inside of a day. With a yacht
    at one&rsquo;s disposal, there is no great difficulty, and indeed
    the actual journey by sea from Athens to the anchorage
    in Katakolo Bay is a very pleasant one, and wonderfully
    lovely as to scenery. Athens itself is more beautiful when
    seen from the sea than from any other aspect, and, after
    going through the Corinth Canal, the Gulf of Corinth,
    which is never more than about thirty miles across at its
    broadest portion, provides a succession of views whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span> beauty, both as to colour and to outline, are difficult to
    over-estimate. Olympia itself is wonderfully interesting.
    When the original town was at the height of its fame,
    with its wealth of temples and shrines, to say nothing
    of the most important feature of all,&mdash;the Stadium for
    the Olympic games,&mdash;it must have been one of the
    wonders of the world. Much has been done in the
    way of excavation, so, from the summit of Kronos Hill,
    just to the north of the town, which lies in a sort of
    natural amphitheatre, it is possible to form some sort
    of idea of what its appearance must have been, when
    Olympia was in its glory. But, to my mind, far more
    beautiful than anything else there, and alone worth any
    length of journey to see, is the Hermes of Praxiteles
    that is safely lodged in the little museum. This statue
    was, I believe, found some twenty or thirty years ago
    by an excavating party, and was lying at the bottom of
    the little stream which is still dignified with the name
    of the River Alphios. It is exquisitely beautiful.
    The slight turn of the head that enables the Hermes to
    glance at the lovely little Bacchus perched on his
    shoulder, the beauty of every detail, and the wonderful
    patina, perhaps produced by the many hundreds of
    years immersion, make up altogether what is, in my
    poor judgment, far the most attractive, if not the finest,
    statue in the world. I remember how difficult it was
    to tear oneself away from this wonderful group, and
    how almost disagreeable it was to look at anything else
    in the museum, though, as a matter of fact, not far from
    it stands the Niké of Paconios, which is extremely fine,
    and there are also a quantity of interesting fragments;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span> but the Hermes is so compellingly wonderful, that
    everything else under the same roof seems to be
    second-class.</p>
<p>Altogether the trip to Olympia was an immense
    delight, and even the names on the signposts were
    attractive. There was something very pleasant in
    driving, (even in a shandrydan of a Greek fly), down
    the road to Arcadia!</p>
<p>From Katakolo the Royal Yacht proceeded to
    Naples, at which port the King disembarked for Paris
    and London, the Queen and Princess Victoria remaining
    on board for a further cruise on the Italian coast.</p>
<p>Later in the year I was present at Buckingham
    Palace at a rather mournful little ceremony. Under
    the new Army Organisation Scheme, it had been
    decided to disband the 3rd Battalion of the Scots
    Guards. Naturally, the officers and men of the
    battalion were much distressed at their disappearance
    from the Army List, and, as some sort of consolation,
    the King took the opportunity of parading them at
    Buckingham Palace, so as to take leave of them,
    accepting, at the same time, the custody of their
    colours. This fine battalion paraded under the command
    of Colonel Lawrence Drummond, their Colonel.
    After the parade, the colours were handed over by
    the colour party to the two Equerries-in-Waiting, and
    by them were duly placed in the private chapel of the
    palace, where I have no doubt they remained until the
    late war, when a third battalion was reformed.</p>
<p>Early in 1907 I was once more in Paris in attendance
    on the King and Queen, who took the opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span> of paying a week&rsquo;s visit to that Capital. With the
    exception of a luncheon with the President, there were
    no official functions, and for once in a way it was a
    real holiday for their Majesties. The King and Queen
    occupied the Embassy during the whole of their visit,
    the Ambassador and Ambassadress (then the late Sir
    Francis and Lady Feodorovna Bertie) taking up their
    residence for the time at the Hôtel Bristol.</p>
<p>The British Embassy in Paris is worthy of a few
    words of description, both on account of its historical
    interest and its magnificence as a residence. I question
    whether many of my countrymen realise what a bargain
    was made by the nation, when it was purchased for something
    under £30,000, its value before the late war being
    estimated at about a quarter of a million sterling. It
    was bought on the advice of the Duke of Wellington
    during the occupation of Paris by the Allies after
    Waterloo, and was at the time the Paris home of the
    Prince and Princess Borghese, the Princess being the
    beautiful Pauline, a sister of the great Napoleon.</p>
<p>It is most conveniently situated for an official residence,
    standing as it does, to use the French expression,
    &ldquo;entre cour et jardin,&rdquo; with its entrance on the
    Rue du Faubourg St. Honoré, only a very few hundred
    yards from the Palace of the Élysée, the official residence
    of the President of the French Republic. The
    garden is unusually large for a Paris house, extending
    its border almost to the Avenue des Champs Élysées.</p>
<p>The interior of the &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; (to again use the French
    term) is very magnificent, decorated profusely in the
    approved style of the period of its occupation by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span> Pauline Borghese, and consequently filled with fine
    specimens of Empire furniture, decoration, and bibelots,
    extending even to a fine dinner-service of gold
    plate. The proportions of the great reception and
    dining-rooms on the ground floor are very imposing,
    and they contain some remarkably good specimens of
    mantelpieces and <i>garnitures de cheminées</i> of bronze and
    ormolu.</p>
<p>Just at the top of the great staircase is the small
    dining-room that was used by the King and Queen for
    private luncheons and dinners. This little room is
    hung with some early seventeenth-century Gobelin
    tapestries, which were sent over in the late Lord Bertie&rsquo;s
    time by our Foreign Office for cleaning and restoration;
    at his request they were, after their treatment,
    allowed to remain there, and are the principal ornament
    of the small dining-room to this day. The State bed-rooms
    were, of course, occupied by the King and Queen
    during their visit; the larger of the two is absolutely
    untouched, and remains exactly as it was in Pauline
    Borghese&rsquo;s time. The bed is a splendid specimen of
    Empire work, and so are the toilette tables with their
    hand-chased bronze medallions. The candelabra on
    the mantelpiece are especially beautiful, and there are
    interesting medallion portraits of Pauline and her
    husband on either side of the fire-place.</p>
<p>The drawing-rooms on the first floor were hung
    with pale amber-yellow damask, and also contained all
    their original Empire furniture, with beautiful candelabra
    and chimney-pieces. The smaller of the two in
    those days was used by the Ambassadress as her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span> sitting-room, and amongst other interesting pictures
    there was a portrait of herself and her sister, Lady
    Hardwicke, as girls, (they were the daughters of the
    Lord Cowley who was a long time Ambassador in
    Paris, and I fancy that one, if not both, of the sisters
    was actually born at the Embassy); there was also
    another portrait of Lady Feodorovna Wellesley (as she
    was then) dressed as a bridesmaid to Princess Alexandra
    of Denmark, on her marriage with the Prince of Wales
    in 1863.</p>
<p>To proceed with the King and Queen&rsquo;s stay in
    Paris:&mdash;Amongst the several theatres visited was the
    Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt, where that wonderful artist,
    Madame Bernhardt, was playing in a very pretty little
    poetical piece called <i>Les Bouffons</i>, and apropos of
    Madame Bernhardt and <i>Les Bouffons</i>, the conjunction
    of the two resulted in an extremely pleasant half-hour
    for me. I was sent round to see the illustrious artist
    in question, on the morning of the performance, to ask
    her to put off the hour fixed for the entertainment,
    to enable their Majesties, who had a dinner party, to
    be in time for the beginning. I had known the
    great Sarah in England, but very slightly, and on
    this occasion when I called at her house, though she
    evidently had risen straight from her bed to receive
    me, she kept me long after our business had been
    disposed of, gossiping, and relating all the amusing
    cabotinage of Paris, for, besides being a transcendent
    artist, she was one of the most agreeable of women.</p>
<p>There was a constant succession of luncheons given
    in honour of the distinguished visitors, but the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span> that remains in my memory was at the apartment of
    the late Sir Reginald Lister, then, as Reggie Lister,
    the first Secretary of the Embassy. It was quite a
    small party, but amongst the guests were Monsieur
    and Madame Jean de Reszke. Madame Jean, though
    nominally only an amateur, was practically a great
    artist, and after luncheon was over, she sang as she
    only could sing. She possessed one of the most lovely
    and sympathetic voices I have ever heard, and was,
    moreover, a perfectly trained musician; indeed, Jean
    always averred that she was a better singer than he,
    and I can still remember the enormous pleasure it was
    to listen to her. I had heard her before, at one or two
    of those delightful musical parties that the late Lady
    Ripon used so constantly to give at Coombe,&mdash;parties,
    the like of which I can remember in no other house,
    and I can never expect to experience anything comparable
    to them in the future. For there all the
    greatest artists in the world used to sing as they
    sang nowhere else, knowing, as they did, that in
    their hostess alone, to say nothing of her guests,
    they had the most sympathetic of audiences, and,
    moreover, in her, a kind and constant friend. At so
    many concerts where great singers give us of their
    art, though they cannot help singing well, there is
    always a feeling that they are faithfully performing a
    contract for which they are paid, and the contract
    being completed, are very pleased to have earned their
    money and to go home to bed. At Coombe, on the
    contrary, they sometimes almost fought as to who was
    to get to the piano, and the accompanist first. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span> never was such a thing as a programme; but they
    simply sang whatever came into their heads, or whatever
    they were asked for, for the popularity of that
    very gifted and beautiful lady in musical circles was
    simply boundless. I remember once seeing such
    artists as Destinn, Caruso, and Scotti, with Signor
    Ricordi at the piano, with only one book between the
    four of them, trying through, what was then, an unheard-of
    opera in London,&mdash;<i>Madame Butterfly</i>. Alas! that
    those days have gone for ever, through the untimely
    death of one of the kindest of my friends, and the
    most interesting hostess of my time.</p>
<p>The Paris visit being concluded, the rest of 1907,
    as far as my duties were concerned, was spent to a
    great extent on board the Royal Yacht, for in July the
    Royal Family once more embarked on board her at
    Holyhead for a visit to Ireland and Wales. After
    spending the night on board at Holyhead, Bangor was
    visited to enable the King to lay the foundation-stone
    of the new buildings of the University College of
    Wales.</p>
<p>Two days afterwards the <i>Victoria and Albert</i> was at
    Kingstown, from which port the King and Queen and
    Princess Victoria drove to Dublin for the purpose of
    visiting the Dublin Exhibition, the Marquis of Aberdeen
    being, at that time, Viceroy. To use the usual
    form of the Court Circular, during all the driving that
    was done on this occasion, and on a subsequent visit to
    Leopardstown for the races, &ldquo;the Equerries-in-Waiting
    were in attendance on horseback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have ridden many miles in my time on these sorts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span> of occasions, and any one with any sense of humour can
    get a good deal of fun out of them, by studying the
    attitude of the mobs that one has to pass through;
    but nothing is half so amusing as an Irish crowd. The
    Irish people are always supposed to be the very reverse
    of loyal, but none the less they love a show of any
    kind, and whenever I have been riding in attendance in
    Ireland, though passing only an arm&rsquo;s length off the
    packed masses of humanity that line the streets, I have
    never heard a word, or seen a gesture, of anything
    that was not at any rate friendly.</p>
<p>The following day the Royal party went by road to
    the Leopardstown races. Racing is always good sport
    in Ireland, even when one is dressed in an Equerry&rsquo;s
    riding-kit, which includes a cocked hat, and when
    feeling very hot and dusty after having ridden in front
    of the escort for several miles on the hard high road.
    That particular meeting at Leopardstown produced
    even more amusement than usual. The King gave a
    cup for the winner of an officers&rsquo; race, for which there
    were some thirty starters. There were some fairly
    decent animals entered, the property of officers, and
    ridden by their owners or some brother officer; but
    amongst the whole lot there was only one serious race-horse.
    This horse had been given by a large race-horse
    owner to a departmental officer so short a time before
    the race, as to call forth serious comment. Good odds
    were laid on this animal to win, but curious things
    happen in racing, and especially in Ireland. Some of
    the young officers who were riding in the race with
    no particular chance of winning, but more for the sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span> of taking part in a very amusing contest than anything
    else, had evidently made up their minds, rightly or
    wrongly, that the gift was not a very genuine one, and
    that whatever won, they would take care that this
    particular horse did not. And he did not! At the
    start, a sort of zareba of horses was formed round him,
    and after the flag was dropped, curiously enough,
    whenever he seemed to have a chance of getting
    through his horses, and taking his place, he was invariably
    unlucky in being knocked into, and eventually
    came in with the ruck. An Irish crowd loves and
    understands racing, and is endowed with the keenest
    sense of humour, and the shouts of laughter that
    went up to heaven during this contest did one good
    to hear.</p>
<p>After leaving Kingstown, the Royal Yacht steamed
    up the Bristol Channel on her way to Cardiff. It was
    a lovely morning and full of interest to me, as I could
    recognise many of my old haunts when passing; such
    as Hartland, Lundy Island, beautiful Clovelly,&mdash;where,
    from boyhood onwards, I have spent some of the
    happiest days of my life,&mdash;and the outline of Exmoor,
    where I had so often hunted in my boyhood and
    youth.</p>
<p>The function at Cardiff consisted in the formal
    opening of the new Alexandra Docks, and, later on,
    after lunching with Lord and Lady Bute at their great
    house, which is literally within the town of Cardiff, a
    special non-stop train ran the Royal party up to
    London in time for dinner. I am afraid to say at
    what pace the train must have been running. I only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span> know that the permanent way of the Great Western is
    so well laid that there was no shaking; we might have
    been pottering along at thirty miles an hour instead of
    at considerably over double that speed.</p>
<p>In August the Royal Yacht was again in full commission
    for Cowes, and the opportunity was taken of
    paying a visit to the then brand-new <i>Dreadnought</i>, and
    going outside the island in her, to see the target-practice
    of the then, also new, 12-inch guns. To me, of course,
    it was very interesting, and the visitors on board
    (there was quite a large party, amongst which were
    a great number of ladies, who came by the invitation of
    their Majesties) were, I think, agreeably disappointed
    in the noise made by the firing, which was nothing
    like so ferocious as had been generally expected.</p>
<p>And so ended the year 1907 as far as Court duties
    were concerned.</p>

<h3>A VISIT TO THE NITRATE FIELDS</h3>
<p>In the early part of that same year I had joined the
    Board of Directors of the Leonor Nitrate Company,
    and as I was anxious to make myself familiar with the
    manufacture of Nitrate, at the end of 1907 I accompanied
    a very old friend of mine, Mr. Reginald
    Morris, to Chile, for a trip to the Nitrate Fields.
    Reggie Morris was on the Board of a number of
    Nitrate Companies and Chairman of the Leonor, and
    had been out on business to Chile before, so my
    excursion was made under the most favourable
    auspices. We started from Southampton on a fine
    ship, the s.s. <i>Avon</i>, belonging to the Royal Mail Steamship
    Company, and, after coming in for a very heavy gale
    in the Bay, arriving successively at Vigo and Lisbon
    to pick up some 400 emigrants, proceeded on our
    journey, calling at Madeira, Bahia and Rio de Janeiro
    on our way,&mdash;almost the same route that I had already
    gone by under sail, the first time I went to sea in the old
    training frigate, <i>Bristol</i>, some thirty-six years before.</p>
<p>There were a number of Argentine passengers on
    board, most of whom, (as they adore Paris), we had
    picked up at Cherbourg, where the ship stayed for a
    few hours after leaving Southampton.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>
<p>Nothing of the smallest interest happened on our
    journey out; the only salient fact that remains in my
    memory is, that I came to the conclusion that
    Argentine children, with which the ship swarmed, were
    the most unruly and badly-brought-up specimens I had
    ever come across. They made day and night hideous
    with their noise; their parents and governesses could
    not exert even the smallest control over them, and
    I solemnly wished that there had been a new Herod
    on board to massacre these &ldquo;innocents.&rdquo; I just
    had sufficient knowledge of Spanish to recognise
    &ldquo;swear words,&rdquo; and the language used to the stewards
    and servants by these afore-mentioned &ldquo;innocents&rdquo;
    would have shocked any of the topmen of my sailing-ship
    days.</p>
<p>About the middle of the month we arrived at Rio,
    and were two full days there, so we left the ship and
    spent the night at a delightful hotel high up the
    Corcavado Mountains, which is reached by its own
    little funicular railway. It was midsummer in South
    America, and I shall never forget the gorgeous views
    over the harbour from this mountain hotel. It
    happened to be full moon at the time, so we and our
    fellow-passengers strolled about in the garden for
    hours after dinner, quite unable to go to bed, so
    beautiful was the scene. By the vivid light of a full
    tropical moon the whole of that wonderful panorama
    that is Rio Harbour was plainly visible in every detail;
    indeed so vivid was the moonlight that it was almost
    possible to see colour in the hibiscus that grew like
    weeds in the garden of the hotel. The next day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span> we had a long morning drive in a most up-to-date
    motor-car that had been lent to us by Mr. Sheppard,
    which took us for miles on fine roads bordered by that
    tropical vegetation that is perhaps more gorgeous at
    Rio than almost anywhere.</p>
<p>The mention of our drive in Mr. Sheppard&rsquo;s car
    reminds me that that gentleman, who is so well known
    in South America as being, amongst other things,
    Managing Director of perhaps the most successful
    industry outside the United Kingdom, was a sort
    of &ldquo;Fairy Godmother&rdquo; to us during our stay at Rio.
    He met us when we arrived, provided us with motors
    and steam-launches, entertained us most hospitably, and
    finally put us on board and saw us off.</p>
<p>By the 25th of November we were comfortably
    lodged at a very good hotel in Buenos Ayres, where
    we had to wait until the train,&mdash;which in those days,
    I think, only ran twice a week as an express,&mdash;could take
    us on our way to the frontier.</p>
<p>We were most hospitably received by the Argentine
    gentlemen for whom we had letters, and were made
    honorary members of the Jockey Club, a palatial
    residence about twice the size of Stafford House.
    Things are done on a large scale in the Argentine.
    I discovered that the entrance fee for members of the
    Club was £300! One of our hosts was a charming
    man&mdash;Don Carlos Tompkinson, a descendant on one
    side of that well-known old Cheshire family. He
    himself was a great racing man, and to my delight
    made arrangements for us to go out to luncheon at
    M. Correa&rsquo;s stud farm, a few miles outside the Capital.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span> M. Correa was the gentleman who had purchased the
    King&rsquo;s horse, Diamond Jubilee, for £30,000, a year
    or two before. His stud farm was an enormous
    establishment, and, in addition to Diamond Jubilee,
    there were two other very high-class stallions standing
    there, one of them being that good French horse,
    le Sancy. To show the scale that M. Correa&rsquo;s horse-breeding
    was done on, I happened to say to him that
    £30,000 was a high price, but I supposed that so many
    subscriptions would be taken to Diamond Jubilee that
    no doubt the horse would be a paying asset, when,
    to my surprise, he told me that he took no subscription,
    and that his three horses were never mated except with
    his own mares, of which he owned the best part of
    a hundred.</p>
<p>A few days elapsed and we were in the train that
    crosses the great Argentine plain that reaches to
    Mendoza, a fair-sized town at the base of the Andes.
    At Mendoza we changed to the funicular railway, that
    in those days only reached as far as Los Quevas, where
    we found the work on the Transandine Tunnel in full
    blast. The tunnel has long since been completed, and
    the line now runs through it direct to the Capital,
    Santiago de Chile.</p>
<p>At Los Quevas there was a sort of rest-house where
    we passed the night, and at six the next morning
    we mounted our mules and rode over the pass, and
    though it is almost the lowest of the Andes passes,
    even there a height of 13,000 feet is reached. I had
    looked forward immensely to the ride, which I expected
    to enjoy, but all enjoyment was made, more or less,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span> impossible, for, like every one else, I suffered from
    mountain sickness, which, though it only took, in
    my case, the form of a splitting headache, was sufficiently
    disagreeable to discount considerably the
    pleasure of riding over the Andes.</p>
<p>At this altitude we had, of course, easily reached the
    snow line, and felt the cold considerably, having been
    fairly roasted in the train only the day before; but
    in spite of all these trifling inconveniences, it was
    an interesting ride, and the scenery was very wild and
    grand. The mules were good beasts, but, being
    generally in the habit of carrying packs, preferred
    to walk on the extreme edge of the mountain paths
    that we had to ascend, and until one became accustomed
    to it, there was something rather uncanny in proceeding
    in single file with one&rsquo;s outside leg well over the edge
    of the precipices. But it is quite useless to attempt to
    argue with a mule, and we soon got used to it. At
    almost the extreme summit of the pass there is a
    colossal statue of Our Saviour, which marks the
    boundary between the two countries of Argentine and
    Chile, and the descent at once commences. The mules
    carried us as far as the Chilean village of Huncal, and
    there the passengers, with their luggage, were trans-shipped
    into a number of rattletrap carriages which
    drove at a furious speed down the mountain side to the
    first railway-station on the Chilean side, where we took
    train to Santiago, at which place we arrived on the 1st
    of December.</p>
<p>At Santiago we settled down for a few days at the
    Hôtel Oddo, as there were some business men to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span> interview on the subject of Nitrate Concessions, one of
    whom was a gentleman who is now well known in
    London, namely Señor Augustine Edwards, for he and
    his charming wife, Madame Edwards, have, for some
    time past, been representing Chile, at the Chilean
    Legation in Grosvenor Square. Another leading personage
    amongst the business men of Chile, whose
    acquaintance I was fortunate enough to make out there,
    was Señor Merry del Val, a brother of the well-known
    Cardinal of that name, another brother of the same
    family being Don Alfonso Merry del Val, the Spanish
    Ambassador at present in London.</p>
<p>Santiago is quite an attractive town, beautifully
    situated at the base of the Andes, and with every sort
    of comfort in the shape of a good hotel and an
    excellent club. At the time, I was much struck with
    the enormous number of unfinished churches that
    abounded in the Capital, and naturally wanted to
    &ldquo;know the reason why.&rdquo; I was told,&mdash;but whether
    it is true or not I have not a notion,&mdash;that as long as
    a church is in construction money is sent from Rome
    to assist in the building expenses, this grant obviously
    coming to an end when the sacred edifice is completed.
    Oddly enough, apparently no church ever is finished,
    so the grant goes on almost to perpetuity. <i>Se non è
    vero, è ben trovato.</i></p>
<p>We succeeded in getting a day&rsquo;s racing at Santiago
    before leaving for Valparaiso to embark for Iquique,
    the principal Nitrate Port on the Chilean coast. There
    is so much Spanish blood in the Chilean nation that
    great punctuality is not to be expected; but even then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span> it was rather more than one could bargain for, to find
    that the first race advertised for 2.30, did not start
    eventually until a little after five!</p>
<p>It was an easy journey to Valparaiso, and after a
    short stay there we embarked on a coasting steamer
    that duly conveyed us to Iquique, where we arrived
    on December 9th, and where the real work of the tour
    was to commence.</p>
<p>On arriving at Iquique we were met by Mr. Noel
    Clarke, who, besides being British Consul, was also the
    head of a large firm which did general trade all along
    the coast, and was intimately connected with the Nitrate
    business. Noel Clarke was destined to have a very
    busy time during the next few months, as will be
    explained later. Meanwhile, he and his very charming
    wife took us in at their house near the outskirts of the
    town, where we lived during our stay at Iquique, in
    the greatest comfort and in the pleasantest surroundings.</p>
<p>Iquique was not a bad sort of town at all. It
    boasted of some very respectable public buildings, and,
    being largely inhabited by English merchants, naturally
    possessed the inevitable club, race-course, and polo-ground.
    Its principal source of prosperity really
    consisted in the anchorage, where steamers and the large
    sailing-clippers could lie very comfortably waiting for
    their cargoes of nitrate, the long sea-coast of Chile being,
    on the whole, very badly off for harbours.</p>
<p>While on the subject of the coast, I must say something
    about my impressions of the Pacific. I had sailed,
    in my time, on most seas, but this visit was my first
    experience of the Pacific Ocean, and I found it extra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>ordinarily
    attractive. Though I have never seen it
    except when it was completely acting up to its name,
    I have no doubt but what occasional terrific gales occur
    there, as elsewhere. But what delighted me was the
    bird and beast life of the coast (I wonder whether a
    sea-lion is correctly described as a beast?), and the
    eternal and enormous rollers that never ceased to tumble
    in. What caused these huge waves remained a mystery
    to me, for, after days of absolutely flat calm, without a
    breath of wind, they still came rolling in as majestically
    as ever. As a general rule, the little patch of smooth
    water that is to be found inside the protection of the
    breakwater, that exists at all the ports, is only deep
    enough for lighters and small craft generally, so the
    steamers anchor outside and land their passengers in
    boats. It is quite an exciting moment when the boat
    reaches the narrow entrance. The usual practice is to
    wait just outside the passage to the breakwater until
    three unusually heavy rollers have expended themselves.
    The three very large ones are invariably followed by a
    succession of small ones, advantage of which has to be
    taken at once, and a dash made for the entrance.
    Meanwhile, sea-birds of every sort and description are
    wheeling about in a cloudless sky or pursuing their
    prey in the bluest of seas, and the amiable sea-lions
    and sea-cows, and such like, loll about on the rocks all
    around and survey the scene with perfect placidity.</p>
<p>A very few days after our arrival, we started for the
    Pampas, to pay a round of visits to the different Nitrate
    establishments in which Morris was interested, and to
    give me an opportunity of learning something about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span> industry before visiting, and reporting on, the Leonor,
    to which place I subsequently had to travel from
    Antofagasta, a port some little distance to the southward
    of Iquique. The first part of our journey was
    done on horseback, the place we were to visit being only
    some twenty miles from the coast. All the rest of our
    tour of inspection was done in a small special train, that
    had been placed at our disposal for that purpose by the
    courtesy of the Railway Authorities at Iquique.</p>
<p>We (our hostess and host, Morris and myself)
    started off one afternoon about four, so as to escape the
    great heat of mid-day, and arrived at our first halting-place
    in time for dinner after a most delightful ride.
    The next day, of course, was spent in inspecting the
    establishment, and, as far as I was concerned, in getting
    a more finished knowledge of the business. The <i>caliche</i>, as the stuff is called that is extracted by a
    species of surface mining, is put into crushers and
    subsequently boiled, the residue turning into a white
    powdery substance that is the nitrate of sodium required.
    There is nothing very mysterious about the business,
    the only real peculiarity of the nitrate fields is that,
    fortunately for the industry, rain is absolutely unknown
    there, for a couple of days&rsquo; heavy rain would wash all the
    sodium out of the ground, and the Pampas would then
    be a desert without the saving presence of an important
    industry. During the few days I was up in these parts
    I visited several establishments that were in the hands
    of English Companies; without exception they were
    completely run by young Englishmen. These youths,&mdash;for
    they were very little more,&mdash;were typical speci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>mens
    of Public School boys, who, after being knocked
    into shape at a Public School, and only being possessed
    of limited private means, had started as clerks in the
    various business houses on the coast, and then, as soon as
    they were considered qualified, had been sent up country
    to assist in running an <i>officina</i>. At  some of these
    factories there were probably upwards of 600 workmen,
    mostly Chilénos, men who are of a really fine fighting
    race, and apt to be extremely turbulent. It made one
    feel proud of one&rsquo;s countrymen, to see the admirable way
    that these young fellows handled their workmen. I
    fancy what tended more to preserve law and order than
    anything else, was the introduction of football, to which
    game the Chileans took very kindly; and when they
    realised what hard plucky men they were working
    under,&mdash;and nowhere, probably, are these qualities
    quicker detected than they are at football,&mdash;turbulent as
    they were by nature, and terribly inclined to be too ready
    with a revolver, it was extraordinary how little trouble
    they generally gave. One of the questions invariably
    asked by the visiting Directors was, whether the men
    had any complaint to make about their treatment by the
    employers, and whether they made any claim for an
    increase in wages. In every case that came under my
    notice the invariable answer was that there were no
    complaints, and this fact is fully corroborated by a
    Foreign Office dispatch that I read many months after
    I had returned to England.</p>
<p>In view of what happened a day or two afterwards,
    this absence of any apparent motive for trouble becomes
    a curious and interesting fact. That there had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span> been considerable labour difficulties recently, we knew
    as soon as we had arrived at Iquique. There had been
    a strike on the Nitrate Railway Works just before our
    arrival, but that had been settled, and there was a
    strike of stevedores at Iquique still in progress, when
    we left the coast for the Pampas, but as far as the
    labourers of the various <i>officinas</i> that we hoped to visit,
    were concerned, we had no reason to suspect any mischief,
    and our first two or three visits of inspection
    were made in a time (apparently) of profound peace.
    It was somewhat of a surprise when, on the 14th of
    December, only three days after our arrival, it became
    extremely evident that a serious strike had begun in
    the Nitrate District, and that the sooner we got into
    our train and returned to the coast the better it would
    be,&mdash;the alternative being to be marooned in an <i>officina</i>,
    where no work was going on, for an indefinite period.
    Luckily our little special was lying in a siding close by,
    and off we went just in time, for already the strikers
    had commenced their march on Iquique. Indeed
    within a very few hours after the time that our train
    had returned to that town, many hundreds of them
    (having very wisely come to the conclusion that marching
    through the Pampas in midsummer was exceedingly
    thirsty work), had seized what railway stock they could
    lay their hands on, and, as many as there was room
    for, made the journey to the coast by train.</p>
<p>Of course, as is the case in all strikes, in all countries,
    the usual ineffective promise of protection by soldiers
    and police was given to the many men who wished to
    go on with their extremely well-paid work, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span> threats and blows of the strikers proved far more
    effective than Government promises; the line of least
    resistance was duly taken, and the would-be workers
    joined the strike. As long as the strikers were on the
    Pampas they did not behave particularly badly; they
    did not in the least dislike the managers and staff at the <i>officinas</i>, under whom they worked, and in no case, as far
    as I know, was any violence or ill-treatment extended
    to them during the time of their forced inactivity and
    species of imprisonment, while the railway was in the
    hands of the strikers; and when our train crawled slowly
    through them, stopping constantly to avoid accidents,
    they neither derailed it, nor attempted to take possession
    of it, either of which they could have easily done, and
    contented themselves with a certain amount of booing
    and hissing, which broke no bones. Naturally, any
    establishment that contained food or drink was at once
    looted, but beyond that next to nothing in the way of
    damage to property was attempted.</p>
<p>However, as may be readily imagined, the members
    of our little party were not sorry to be back on the coast
    again, to settle down at the Casa Clarke until events
    had arranged themselves. We had no sooner returned
    to Iquique on the evening of the 14th, before the news
    reached us that the strike had become general so far as
    the Nitrate Fields were concerned, and on the next day
    some 4000 men, apparently well organised, could be
    seen marching down from the hills towards the town.
    It was fairly evident by this time that there was going
    to be serious trouble, and it is not to be denied that the
    strike leaders, one of whom was said to be a well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>-known
    Spanish anarchist, had chosen their moment
    well. To begin with, the Intendente of the Province,
    Señor Carlos Eastman, was at Santiago, where he had
    gone to present his resignation to the President; the
    General commanding the district, General Silva Renard,
    and his second in command, were both away in Santiago,
    leaving the troops in temporary charge of a comparatively
    inexperienced officer, and he, like all temporary
    commanders, was extremely averse to taking the responsibility
    for decided measures; and, by way of making
    the list of absentees complete, the Prefect of Police was
    also in the Capital. In addition, as I have mentioned
    before, the stevedores were also out on strike, so one
    way and another the position was extremely unpleasant.</p>
<p>At first, the Acting Commandante of the Troops
    seemed as if he were disposed to enforce order, and
    when the first lot of strikers from the Pampas arrived
    in the vicinity of the town, they were headed off by
    troops to a camp that had been prepared for them on
    the race-course, and there seemed some prospect of the
    men returning to the Pampas in trains which the
    Nitrate Railway Company were very ready to place at
    their disposal.</p>
<p>Apparently this attitude was only a bluff, for what
    eventually happened was, (in spite of the assurances
    given by the Acting Commandante of the Troops and
    the Acting Intendente of the Province, that the strikers
    would be prevented from entering the town by the
    military), that on the next day, the 16th of December,
    the Pampas strikers, and the transport-workers strikers
    of the town, joined together, took complete charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span> of the town, and stopped not only all traffic, but
    all work of every description, all the shops having
    been forced to close, and, meanwhile, reinforcements
    of strikers were hourly arriving from the Pampas,
    some on foot and others in trains that they had
    commandeered.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to say that, during these days,
    Reggie Morris and myself, living, as we were, at the
    English Consulate, knew from hour to hour what was
    going on, from our host, for we occasionally saw him
    when he came to his house to snatch a morsel of food.
    He displayed the greatest energy, and, had his advice
    been taken by the Authorities, in all probability a great
    deal of inconvenience, to say nothing of bloodshed,
    would have been saved. But whenever he requested
    the Acting Commandante to take certain measures with
    regard to the railway, which belonged to a British company,
    his proposals were invariably first accepted, and
    then never carried out, and when he attempted to
    confer with the Acting Intendente he was always informed
    that this great official was either too busy or
    else asleep, and referred to some one else, who was
    generally a lawyer interested in local  politics.</p>
<p>For the inside of a week the town of Iquique was in
    a state of subdued chaos. Nothing happened; there
    were no tramways running, no cabs, no shops open,
    and, oddly enough, next to no disorder. The market
    was open for a short time in the morning, whither our
    intrepid hostess used daily to drive her pony cart, returning
    with the day&rsquo;s provisions. There was absolutely
    nothing to do all day, and, judging from our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span> feelings, the inhabitants of Iquique must have been
    slowly dying of intense boredom. As for ourselves,
    except for an hour or two in the evening when we
    mounted our host&rsquo;s ponies and went for a gallop down
    the coast and round the race-course, occupation we
    had none.</p>
<p>But meanwhile things were beginning to move at
    Santiago. Noel Clarke had been in constant telegraphic
    communication with Mr. Rennie, then the British
    Chargé des Affaires, and received at last the welcome
    intelligence that the real Intendente, Señor Carlos
    Eastman, accompanied by General Renard, were leaving
    Valparaiso in the Chilian warship <i>Zenteno</i>, with
    reinforcements of troops. Very shortly afterwards,
    another Chilian cruiser, the <i>Esmeralda</i>, arrived, but
    without the troops, that she was expected to bring.</p>
<p>Though there was but little actual disorder in the
    town, a number of the more respectable families began
    to get alarmed, principally owing to the panic-stricken
    attitude of their servants, a number of the women
    having taken refuge on board the merchant ships in
    the harbour. There was some cause for anxiety, the real
    danger being that of fire. A town like Iquique, largely
    built of wood, where rain is unknown, and where the
    water supply depends upon a pipe-line from the hills,
    is particularly open to danger of conflagration when in
    the hands of some thousands of strikers, many of whose
    pockets are known to be stuffed full of dynamite.</p>
<p>The only other amusement, besides the evening
    ride, was to attend the meetings held by the strikers.
    Spaniards of all shades are passionately fond of oratory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span> and of the sound of their own voices. I suppose
    the inherent beauty and sonority of their language
    fascinates them, and the speeches were endless. I,
    alas! have very little knowledge of Spanish, so did not
    understand much, but I gathered from those who
    knew the language that their eloquence was principally
    employed in condemning the Government, vituperating
    the employers, and, what was novel in Chile, preaching
    an anti-European doctrine.</p>
<p>However, the climax was approaching.</p>
<p>On the 19th, the <i>Zenteno</i> arrived with Don Carlos
    Eastman, General Renard, and a welcome reinforcement
    in the shape of the O&rsquo;Higgins Regiment.</p>
<p>The Intendente duly landed, the streets being lined
    with troops. All the strikers congregated to witness
    his arrival, their total number in the small town of
    Iquique being estimated at anything between 12,000
    and 16,000 men.</p>
<p>On the following day the Intendente received a
    deputation consisting of the committee of the strikers.
    He then called a meeting of the employers, and finally
    had a private interview with Noel Clarke, as doyen of
    the Foreign Consuls at Iquique.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 21st, a state of siege was
    proclaimed in the town, proclamations to that effect
    being posted, and notices in the local papers. One
    more attempt was made by the Intendente to induce
    the strikers to return to their work, but his note
    received an insolent answer couched in a sort of semiofficial
    language, which pointed to the fact that it was
    more of an attempt at a revolution, than a mere strike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span> of workmen, that was confronting the Chilean Government.
    Fortunately for Chile, and for the Europeans
    who were in that country or had interests there, Don
    Carlos Eastman was a man who was not to be trifled
    with by an ignorant mob of strikers, headed by a band
    of anarchists and revolutionaries. The time for action
    had come, and was quickly seized. Owing to the
    overcrowding of the town by these thousands of
    strikers; (in addition to the danger of conflagration
    already alluded to,) there was a distinct risk of an
    epidemic breaking out, from the said overcrowding,
    and the filthy and insanitary habits of the men from
    the Pampas. Measures had to be taken to remove
    these unwelcome guests from the town, and they were
    taken at once.</p>
<p>The General in command of the troops was commanded
    by the Intendente to surround the strikers in
    the principal square, the Escuela Santa Maria, where
    they were holding one of their everlasting meetings, and
    order them to leave the town; warning them that if they
    had not moved off before the clock struck four, force
    would be used. Meanwhile, every effort was made by
    the officers present, from the General downwards, to
    persuade the strikers to retire, but all their eloquence
    was only met, by counter-abuse and violent and revolutionary
    speeches by the men&rsquo;s leaders, who then retired
    to the building which was used as the headquarters of
    the committee. The General then ordered all peaceful
    inhabitants to withdraw. Advantage of this was taken
    by some of the strikers, who left the ranks of their
    comrades. At the last stroke of four, fire was opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span> on the building that sheltered the committee, and on
    the strikers, by a couple of machine-guns. The firing
    lasted about a minute, and then, without any further
    fuss, a long column of strikers marched out of the
    town to the race-course, flanked on either side by troops,
    and almost immediately began to entrain to go back
    to their work on the Nitrate Fields.</p>
<p>While the firing was going on we were all on the
    roof of the Casa Clarke, about a quarter of a mile from
    the Escuela Santa Maria, but as soon as it was over
    Morris and I went down into the street to watch the
    procession pass.</p>
<p>The Chileans are a fine fighting race, and, to use the
    old &ldquo;ring&rdquo; expression, took their &ldquo;gruel&rdquo; like men.
    I heard afterwards that they had begun to return the
    fire with revolvers and carbines, but machine-gun fire
    was too much for them, and in about a minute there
    were about four hundred of them down, of which
    some one hundred and twenty or so were dead. When
    they passed us in the street, though every now and
    then a badly wounded man would fall down in his
    tracks, there were no complaints or curses at the troops.
    They simply realised that the leaders had lost, and
    that they had to pay for it. As usual, not a single
    one of these same leaders, who were pretty well known
    to the authorities, were found amongst the killed or
    wounded, and all attempts to get hold of them failed.
    Somehow or another, with the aid of their sympathisers
    in the town, they all succeeded in getting clear away.</p>
<p>I do not propose to deduce any moral from this rather
    detailed account of a strike of a few thousand workmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span> in a South American Republic; but in these days,
    when we all live, in this country, under the perpetual
    threat of strikes of all sorts and descriptions, up to a
    General Strike, it may be of interest to any one who
    happens to read these pages, to learn, how officials who
    are not afraid to act, (though living in a thoroughly
    democratic country under a Republican form of
    Government,) can restore law and order, when they
    are threatened with revolution, under the guise of
    labour discontent.</p>
<p>With the return of the Nitrate workers to the
    Pampas, the worst of the strike was over; but Iquique
    was still distinctly non-normal during the rest of my
    short stay there.</p>
<p>I was very anxious to get down the coast to Antofagasta
    to visit the Leonor property and report on it
    before returning to England, where I was due for duty
    on the 1st of February; but the difficulty was to find
    a steamer that was going down the coast, as, owing
    to the strike of the stevedores, they could not take in
    cargo. However, I eventually succeeded in getting a
    passage in a tramp steamer that was going in the
    right direction. The next difficulty was to get on
    board, as there was still a transport strike going on,
    and consequently no public conveyances were available.
    I wrote to the Intendente and explained my situation
    as regards having to be back in England by a certain
    date, and he at once came to the rescue. As far as
    water transport was concerned, I was quite all right,
    as Captain Wilson, commanding the Chilean Cruiser <i>Zenteno</i>, was an old comrade of mine and promptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span> produced a steam pinnace to put me on board my
    steamer. I shall never forget my triumphant exit
    from Iquique. At the hour of my departure a most
    forlorn old pony-victoria, dragged by two equally
    forlorn mules, turned up at the door of the Casa Clarke,
    this equipage being surrounded by one of the best
    turned out and smartest escorts, (of Lancers), that
    I have ever seen. My luggage naturally filled the
    inside of the little carriage to overflowing, as well as
    the so-called box-seat, so away I went, sitting on the
    top of my pile of luggage, with the escort round me,
    amidst the laughter and jeers of my kindest of hosts and
    hostesses, and of my Chairman, who was remaining at
    Iquique, to finish off his interrupted visit to the <i>officinas</i> of the Tarapaca district.</p>
<p>The rest of my journey was quite uneventful. My
    steamer took me to Antofagasta, where I passed a few
    busy days inspecting the Leonor property, that had
    been recently acquired by the Company on whose
    board I sat. Our mining surveyor, who had reported
    on it, had, through no fault of his own, rather let us
    down. A sufficient proportion of nitrate was present
    all right, but, unfortunately, the rock that it was mixed
    up with proved on working to be abnormally hard,
    and was constantly breaking our crushing-engines, so
    eventually the property was not looked upon as a
    first-class paying proposition and was sold. When I
    was there, the crushing had hardly begun, and the
    report I sent to my Chairman was more concerned with
    the buildings of the <i>officina</i>, the managing officers,
    and the water supply.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>
<p>I succeeded in hitting off another steamer going
    south, and a few days afterwards was in Valparaiso.
    There I only waited for the Transandine train, which,
    as it turned out, entailed three or four days&rsquo; delay,&mdash;days
    very pleasantly spent at Vigna-del-Mar, a charming
    suburb a few miles out of the town where all the
    rich merchants have their villas, and where there is
    also about the best hotel in Chile. Amongst other
    attractions, it boasted of a race-course, and a little
    club, where I believe very big baccarat occasionally went
    on; altogether &ldquo;Vigna,&rdquo; as it was always called,
    was an extremely pleasant place. My journey back
    over the Andes was extremely like the outward trip,
    the only difference was that from the Pacific side the
    pass was crossed over in a four-horsed carriage instead
    of mule-back. I infinitely preferred the mule, as it
    was sickening to have to witness the everlasting
    flogging of the good and willing horses by their brutal
    drivers. I had another short stay at Buenos Ayres
    while waiting for the mail boat, and eventually returned
    to England in the last days of January, just in time
    to take up a month&rsquo;s duty as Equerry-in-Waiting.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>
<h3>1910</h3>
<p>I had hardly arrived at Buckingham Palace and settled
    down to work before the news was received of the
    assassination of King Carlos and of his son, the Crown
    Prince, in the streets of Lisbon. It was a particularly
    brutal murder, for Queen Amelie was in the carriage
    with them, and saw her husband and son murdered
    before her eyes. The late King Carlos and his Consort
    had been so very recently the guests of our Royal
    Family, and were on such very friendly terms with
    them that the shock must have been felt most acutely.
    I was in attendance at both the Memorial Services
    that were held in London, the first of which was a
    Requiem Mass at St. James&rsquo; Church, Spanish Place,
    and on the following day at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. It
    was said to have been the first time an English
    Sovereign had been present at a Roman Catholic
    Service since the Reformation. The Service at St.
    Paul&rsquo;s was very beautiful and impressive, and in those
    days before the war, for many of those present, it was
    a unique experience to hear the drums of the Guards
    accompanying the organ in the Dead March; I know
    of no place where drums are heard to such effect, as
    under the great dome of Sir Christopher Wren.</p>

<p>Probably all my fellow-Londoners will agree with
    me that the average February is about the most
    unpleasant month of the year to spend in London,
    and there always seems to be more influenza and other
    comparatively minor disorders prevalent then, than at
    any other time. London was, moreover, apt to be
    very full in the month of February, for Parliament
    generally met during the month, and there were always
    endless dinners, political and otherwise. In 1908 there
    was a good deal of influenza flying about, so the King
    was persuaded to go to Brighton for a week, staying
    during this short visit at the Princess Royal&rsquo;s house
    in Lewes Crescent that had been placed at his disposal.
    Personally, I was very glad to be at Brighton for
    a week, for there is something about the air there,
    that revives the jaded Londoner more surely than
    anything else.</p>
<p>In the month of June I was again on duty, and
    consequently came in for the visit their Majesties
    paid to the late Emperor and Empress of Russia at
    Reval. It was an interesting occasion from many
    points of view, and looking back on it from these
    days, I imagine there can hardly be any of the Russians
    we met during that visit, including the Imperial
    Family, that have not been murdered by Revolutionaries
    or butchered by their successors, the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>On June 5th, the Royal party, consisting of the
    King, the Queen, and Princess Victoria, embarked on
    board the <i>Victoria and Albert</i> at Port Victoria. We
    were quite a large party in attendance, as, in addition
    to the necessary Private Secretaries and Equerries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span> Lord Carnock (then Sir Arthur Nicholson, the Ambassador
    at Petersburg) Mr. Hugh O&rsquo;Beirne, also of that
    Embassy, (who, poor fellow, met his death with the
    late Lord Kitchener on their ill-fated voyage to
    Russia during the war,) Lord Hamilton of Dalziel,
    (as Lord-in-Waiting, doing the duty of Lord Chamberlain,)
    and Sir John Fisher, (then First Sea-Lord, and
    Principal Naval Aide-de-Camp to the King,) were on
    board the Royal Yacht. An escorting squadron of
    our latest type of armoured cruisers, the then well-known
    &ldquo;Minotaur&rdquo; class, was ordered to join the Royal
    Yacht at Kiel. (Incidentally, it was interesting to
    notice, during the war, what a singularly useless class
    of vessel was the armoured cruiser. After a little
    more than a year&rsquo;s warfare afloat, we had lost nearly
    every specimen of that class we possessed, and oddly
    enough, the Germans were in a similar state; the fact
    is they were too big and too expensive for cruisers;
    they carried their main armament far too low, and if
    they came across anything in the shape of a battle-cruiser
    they were sunk for a certainty.) On this
    occasion the <i>Minotaur</i> and her consorts had, I believe,
    been chosen because they drew too much water to
    go through the Canal, and though, of course, the
    Admiralty may have thought it an excellent jest to
    score off the Germans, by poking fun at their strategic
    Canal, the joke was not likely to delay the broadening
    and deepening of that same channel, a work which,
    carried out at a cost of many millions, was taken in
    hand very shortly afterwards, and duly completed in
    time for the long-contemplated war of 1914. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span> Royal Yacht arrived at Kiel in the evening and was
    at once boarded by Prince Henry and the usual huge
    swaggering crowd of Germans, that formed the Teutonic
    idea of what the suite of a Prince should be.
    We were duly informed that the escorting squadron
    had arrived at Kiel, which gave Sir John Fisher a
    chance of airing the carefully prepared Admiralty gibe
    about the insufficient size of the Canal, and the
    magnificence of our cruisers. Much as I always disliked
    the Germans, on this particular occasion I was
    rather glad that Prince Henry had also a well-thought-out
    impromptu ready. He retaliated by chaffing
    the Admiral about the wireless installation that
    had just been put up at Whitehall, the news of
    which extremely recent acquisition had already reached
    Germany. There could be no secret about an installation
    that the whole world could see, and from
    nowhere better than from Carlton House Terrace;
    but it was instructive to learn how carefully our
    public buildings were watched by the inmates of the
    German Embassy.</p>
<p>The Royal Yacht anchored for the night at Kiel,
    and left next morning with her escorting squadron
    for Reval. For the first hour or so there was an
    escorting flotilla of German Destroyers, who were
    evidently very anxious to show off, and were certainly
    sufficiently well handled. The next twenty-four hours
    or so were spent at sea, and nothing can be more
    agreeable than a long day and night afloat in the
    Baltic during the month of June, when it is light all
    night, except for a short hour round midnight, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span> there is apt to be still a suspicion of pink in the
    sky.</p>
<p>The Royal Yacht arrived at Reval on the morning
    of June 9th, and there we found the two Imperial
    Yachts, <i>Polar Star</i> and the <i>Standardt</i>, the Dowager
    Empress being on board the one, the other being the
    temporary residence of the Emperor and Empress and
    their children. There was also a Russian squadron
    anchored in the roads, which, augmented by our
    escorting cruiser squadron, made up a fine show
    of ships.</p>
<p>Even then, that part of Russia was in a very disturbed
    state, so much so that none of the suite, or
    the officers of our fleet, were allowed to land, in
    case of trouble; and no boats, with the exception of
    men-o&rsquo;-war&rsquo;s boats, were permitted to ply at all in
    the part of the anchorage that had been assigned to
    the Royal Yachts of both nations.</p>
<p>The whole visit passed off very agreeably, the
    Russians in those days being always the pleasantest
    of people to deal with, but underlying it all there
    was the feeling that the country we were in was in
    a very abnormal state. The Empress was palpably
    in a nervous condition, and no wonder, considering
    the constant dangers to which her children were
    exposed. Among the notable people in attendance on
    the Emperor were Monsieur Stolypin, the President
    of the Council of Ministers; Baron Zahamelsky, the
    Governor-General of the Baltic Provinces, besides such
    personal attendants as General Count Paul Benckendorff
    and Prince Orloff, who were Aides-de-Camp to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span> the Emperor; the former was also a brother of the
    well-known and much-liked Ambassador in London.
    Monsieur Stolypin, as will be remembered, was eventually
    murdered in the Opera House of St. Petersburg.
    After many attempts against his life, the assassinating
    party at last succeeded in its object,&mdash;a previous attack
    on his life, when a bomb was exploded in his house,
    had only wounded him and maimed one of his children
    for life.</p>
<p>At the State dinner party I happened to sit next to
    one of the Russian gentlemen who had held the post
    of Governor of the Palace for a couple of years, and
    he gave me an idea of the terrible responsibility that
    this office carried, in that, amongst other things, he was
    personally responsible for the safety of the Emperor.
    But, as I have written in a previous page, I doubt
    whether there is one of those men, (all of whom were
    either public servants or else attached to the Emperor&rsquo;s
    person during that visit), who is now alive. Of the fate
    of the members of the Imperial Family, it is unnecessary
    to write. All Europe has read with horror of the
    indignities they suffered before being murdered.</p>
<p>But to turn to less gloomy memories: there were the
    usual State banquets on board the Royal Yachts of the
    two monarchs; at the one given by King Edward we,
    of his suite, were much impressed by the amusing way
    in which he settled a difficult question of etiquette. In
    Russia the Dowager Empress is of higher rank than
    the Consort of the Emperor; in England, of course,
    the reverse is the case. As both these illustrious ladies
    were dining on board the <i>Victoria and Albert</i>, anchored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span> in Russian waters, it was a rather nice point to whom
    to give precedence in arranging the seating of the
    guests at the banquet. Following a precedent set by
    Solomon, in a reversed sense, the King solved the
    difficulty by taking both Empresses in to dinner, one
    on each arm!</p>
<p>After the dinner on board the Emperor&rsquo;s yacht, the <i>Standardt</i>, a serenading party of singers came off from
    the shore in a tug, which was then anchored close to
    the Royal Yachts. They sang deliciously while the
    guests were smoking their cigars on deck. Of course
    it was still broad daylight, so that the Royalties were
    in easy view of the singers, and at the outside a couple
    of hundred yards off. This appeared to me to be a
    very risky proceeding, so I sent for an old friend of
    mine, (now Sir Patrick Quinn), then, the Special
    Detective Officer in charge of the King, to ask him
    his opinion. I pointed out to him that in broad daylight,
    as it was, any disaffected person on board the
    tug, if prepared to give up his own life, could make
    a certainty of shooting any member of the two Royal
    Families that he liked to select. Quinn&rsquo;s answer was,
    &ldquo;You need not fuss, Captain; there is not a man or a
    woman on board the tug who has not been stripped by
    the Russian Police and searched for arms before being
    embarked, and when it comes to searching, the Russian
    Police do not make mistakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 11th the Royal Yacht left Reval for England
    via the Kiel Canal, the escorting squadron parting
    company there and finding their way home round
    Denmark. On our way through the Canal the Kaiser,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span> with that wonderful capacity he has always shown
    for unsuccessful theatrical effects, arranged that the
    Royal Yacht should be escorted through the Canal
    by detachments of Cavalry! It would be difficult
    to imagine anything more incongruous and ridiculous
    than was this &ldquo;cocktail&rdquo; performance. The German
    Cavalry, efficient as they are in many respects, do not
    shine as horsemen, and it amused us enormously to see
    these unfortunate troopers bumping along the road that
    runs parallel to the Canal, in their attempts to keep
    up with the Royal Yacht, which was, of course,
    condemned to go at her very slowest speed.</p>
<p>By the 16th the Royal party was back at Buckingham
    Palace; but London was left almost immediately
    for Windsor, where there was a large gathering for the
    Ascot Races.</p>
<p>Ascot Races in 1908 was a more than usually
    brilliant affair. There was an exceptionally large party
    at Windsor, which filled the Castle to its utmost
    capacity, and amongst the guests were some of the
    King&rsquo;s French friends, such as the Prince and Princesse
    Murat, the Marquis and Marquise de Gannay, and that
    very charming man, M. Édouard Detaille, (long since
    dead I am sorry to say), so well known as the very successful
    painter of military subjects. I had often been
    to his studio in Paris, which was almost a museum in
    its way, for he not only managed to acquire Napoleonic
    relics of all sorts, but had also made a most
    remarkable collection of the head-dresses of all the
    regiments of the different armies of that period. In
    these days it seems almost incredible that men should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span> have fought for years in such enormous and fantastic
    head-coverings. A great many of them, I believe,
    were not nearly as uncomfortable as they looked, and
    even in the later Crimean days our Foot-guards stuck
    steadily to their bearskin, which were always said to be
    the only sort of head-dress that the British private did
    not try to get rid of, if he got the chance. But to return
    to Monsieur Detaille; he was even then very delicate,
    and in rather poor health generally, but his kind host
    had told him that he was to go racing or not, just as
    he felt inclined, and to take life as easily as he liked in
    wandering about the Castle, with all its wealth of
    pictures to interest him. Incidentally, there was one
    of his own works there, which still hangs in a very
    prominent position in the large dining-room,&mdash;the
    fine equestrian portrait of King Edward, accompanied
    by his brother, the Duke of Connaught, at an Aldershot
    review. The portrait of the King was certainly
    one of the best of him that ever was painted, and
    the fore-shortening of the fine chestnut charger that he
    is riding is masterly; the horse really looks as if he
    were stepping out of the frame towards the spectator.</p>
<p>Windsor for Ascot Races was rather a strenuous
    time for the Equerries, whose duties it was to ride to
    Ascot and back with the Royal carriage. Seven miles
    does not sound like a long ride, but after a sea-trip,
    where no exercise can be taken, to ride at a full
    trot without any chance of changing the pace, at
    mid-day in the month of June, made me much hotter
    than did polo at Malta played in the great heat of a
    Mediterranean summer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>
<p>In March 1909, I once more found myself <i>en route</i> to
    Biarritz in attendance on King Edward. Only a very
    short stay was made in Paris, just time for a luncheon
    with the President at the Élysée, as the King was
    anxious to get to the South. They were pleasant
    weeks, those five or six that were spent there, for
    Biarritz was very full and gay, and I came in for some
    agreeable and interesting motor trips. Amongst
    others, was an excursion to Pau to see the Wilbur
    Wright flying-machine. Mr. Wilbur Wright had, I
    fancy, chosen Pau for his experimental flights because
    not only is there a nice flat tract of country just outside
    the town, but Pau possesses, and also thoroughly
    deserves, the reputation of being one of the most
    windless places in Europe. When flying-machines
    were in their extreme infancy, a very moderate breeze
    was enough to prevent an aviator from making an
    ascent. On this occasion the elements were kind, and
    Mr. Wright made two or three ascents, on one occasion
    taking his sister up with him. In those earlier days of
    flying, the great difficulty was to get the machine off
    the ground, and it was met by a combination of about
    a hundred yards of light railway to take the wheels of
    the machine, and the erection of a shears with a dropping
    weight to give the plane the necessary cant-up in
    the air. Another interesting motor excursion was
    made to San Sebastian. It is a lovely drive across the
    Spanish frontier, and full of interest to Englishmen,
    with its historic memories of Wellington&rsquo;s advance
    into France. Besides being a pleasant excursion it
    gave the King an opportunity of paying an informal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span> visit to King Alfonso, who was then in residence at
    the Royal Villa at San Sebastian.</p>
<p>By the middle of April, what was to be my last visit
    to Biarritz in attendance came to an end, and I returned
    to England, the King having met Queen
    Alexandra and Princess Victoria at the station of
    le Bourget, just outside Paris, where now, I hear, is
    placed the main Aerodrome in the vicinity of that
    capital. The Royal party changed trains and went on
    to Genoa for a short cruise in the Royal Yacht.</p>
<p>I was again on duty for the Cowes season, and an
    interesting season it was, commencing, as it did, with a
    review of the Home and Atlantic Fleets at Spithead,
    followed immediately afterwards by the arrival of the
    Emperor and Empress of Russia and their children in
    the Imperial Yacht <i>Standardt</i>. The Imperial Family
    began the official portion of their visit by coming on
    board the <i>Victoria and Albert</i>, from which vessel the
    Emperor reviewed the Fleet, which was still at Spithead.
    The usual State dinners took place on board the two
    Royal Yachts, but beyond that there were no further
    functions. The members of the Russian Imperial
    Family were evidently delighted to be out of their own
    country, even on a four days&rsquo; visit, and it was pathetic
    to witness the delight of the children at being able to
    run about the crowded little town of Cowes and look at
    the shop windows at their own sweet will, after being
    for so long accustomed to living in a comparative state
    of siege, where their lives were never safe for a moment.
    The Emperor and Empress landed one day at the steps
    of the Cadet College at Osborne, the Empress being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span> desirous of revisiting those surroundings where she had
    spent so much of her girlhood in Queen Victoria&rsquo;s time.
    For the Emperor to make even such a limited excursion
    as a visit to Osborne and its dependencies, gave great
    anxiety to Scotland Yard, and every sort of precaution
    was taken to ensure his safety. A swarm of detectives
    were posted all round Osborne, and though, as usual,
    their work was so well done that no one, except &ldquo;those
    in the know&rdquo; even suspected their existence, the fact
    remains that an unusually large number had to be
    employed at Cowes and its neighbourhood.</p>
<p>After the visit to Osborne House and its grounds,
    the Cadet College, then a comparatively new institution,
    was visited, and the mention of Osborne College makes
    it almost incumbent on any one who is interested in the
    Navy to point out that of all the hopeless examples of
    bad work done in a hurry, there is no more glaring
    instance than this establishment. (This criticism does
    not apply to its educational side, which I believe to be
    thoroughly well looked after.) I had an opportunity
    of visiting it shortly after it was opened, have seen it
    several times since, and, moreover, on the strength of
    having once been in the Navy, I have been pestered by
    fond mothers on the subject of its most unhealthy
    condition, ever since. Osborne itself was an undeniably
    good choice as regards locality, embraced, as the
    property is, by the sea on two sides, and being within
    easy reach of the great Naval Establishment at Portsmouth.
    Unfortunately, owing to the vanity that impels
    men in authority to get a new thing going without delay,
    it was built on the lines of a temporary structure, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span> next to nothing in the way of foundations, and very
    possibly on tainted ground, the actual site selected being
    perilously near that of the old stables of Osborne
    House. The apparent consequences have been that
    the wretched children, (for the Cadets who go there are
    little more) are never really well, and there have been
    constant epidemics of a serious nature. I have been
    credibly informed that, amongst these epidemics was
    one of &ldquo;pink eye&rdquo; some years ago, a disease that, until
    the Osborne College was started, was supposed to be
    peculiar to horses.</p>
<p>But enough of these unsavoury medical details, which
    only serve to remind me of my own &ldquo;double event&rdquo;
    in the <i>Britannia</i>, and of the remark I once heard made
    almost under his breath by a famous London surgeon,
    when he and I were visiting a celebrated Service Hospital
    not so very far from Osborne: &ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear,
    this is pre-Crimean!&rdquo; But I have wandered from my
    subject, and must return to the Russian visitors.</p>
<p>Amongst the Emperor&rsquo;s entourage on this occasion
    were many of the gentlemen I had met during the
    Reval visit, such as Count Orloff and General Count
    Benckendorff, and in addition, Monsieur Isvolsky, the
    Foreign Minister, and subsequently Russian Ambassador
    in Paris. Monsieur Isvolsky was accompanied
    by a very old friend of mine as his Private Secretary, in
    the person of that extremely agreeable man who, with
    his charming wife, were both so well known in London
    Society as Prince and Princess Demidoff. It amused
    me greatly to notice that, when attached to the suite of
    the Emperor, he was known as Monsieur Demidoff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span> The Princedom which London Society, or the snobs
    amongst them (and they are numerous), had conferred
    on him came simply from the fact that one of his forbears
    had bought the property of San Donato, which
    lies in the environs of Florence, and gives the title of
    Prince of San Donato to any owner who likes to use it.
    The truth is that English people, as a rule, do not realise
    that so-called Princes swarm in Central Europe, especially
    in Italy and Roumania. I know both countries pretty
    well, and to use the colloquial expression, in Bucharest
    you cannot throw a stone without hitting a Prince!</p>
<p>After the termination of their four days&rsquo; visit,&mdash;a visit
    which I veritably believe they enjoyed,&mdash;the members
    of the Russian Imperial Family sailed away in the <i>Standardt</i> on their return journey to their own country,
    and a very few days afterwards I found myself in King
    Edward&rsquo;s special train in attendance and <i>en route</i> to
    Marienbad.</p>
<p>The Marienbad season of 1909 was more animated
    than ever; besides the regular Marienbaders there were
    many new faces to be seen there, noticeably the King of
    the Hellenes, the Duke of Teck, Princess Stephanie
    and Count Longay, Prince and Princess Dolgorouki,
    Princess Hélène Bariatinsky, Slatin Pasha, and such
    well-known Parisians as the Vicomtesse Vigier, Comte
    and Comtesse de Waru, and my old friends, Monsieur
    and Madame Jean de Reszke. I hardly can recollect a
    more agreeable season there, and some of the details of
    conversation at one particular luncheon given by King
    Edward during his stay are indelibly stamped on my
    memory.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>
<p>Monsieur Clemenceau, who had recently arrived at
    Karlsbad, having just succeeded in obtaining his
    freedom by successfully wrecking his own Ministry,
    came over for the day and lunched with King Edward,
    the only other guests being Sir Fairfax Cartwright, our
    Ambassador at Vienna, and Monsieur Crozier, whom I
    had met when French Minister at Copenhagen. Monsieur
    Clemenceau was in tremendous form. I fancy
    that he was really rather glad to be out of office for a
    time, and to do his Karlsbad cure in peace. Although
    in Paris there were the usual number of versions of the
    real reason for the breaking up of his Ministry, none of
    them, I am sure, was as amusing as his own account of
    his fall from power, on which topic he held forth for
    some time. But brilliant and clever as his conversation
    was, there were, to my mind, some very immortal truths
    shining out of it, as might the moon amongst a shower
    of fireworks. It is pitiful having to try and render his
    beautiful French into my halting English, but one or
    two remarks of his made such an impression on me, that
    I have never forgotten them. One in particular referred
    to a fact, or rather a quality, which we, in these days,
    when the object seems to be to reduce every one and
    everything to a dull level, may be apt to lose. Monsieur
    Clemenceau&rsquo;s contention was, that the great fault
    of the French was their hopeless love of logic. His
    countrymen had achieved a more or less successful
    Revolution nominally in support of a perfectly logical
    idea, namely that France should be governed on principles
    ensuring Liberty, Equality, Fraternity for all its
    citizens. However successful the Revolution may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span> been in a general sense, it certainly failed to establish its
    main object. Liberty, he pointed out, is only a dream;
    the freest people in the world, the English, spend their
    lives in inventing new yokes to place on their own
    shoulders. Fraternity, may simply be said to be non-existent,
    owing to the fact that man naturally and
    instinctively preys on his fellow-man. The doctrine
    of Equality has no doubt been fulfilled to a certain
    extent, for, as he somewhat cynically pointed out,
    every one has an equal right to vilify his neighbour.</p>
<p>So much for the logic of the Latin races. According
    to Monsieur Clemenceau, the great strength and mainstay
    of the men of the British race is that, not
    possessing logical minds, they are not to be frightened
    out of cherishing useful anomalies. One of the greatest
    of its anomalies was the continual existence of an
    Hereditary Second Chamber, which, in his opinion, <i>fonctionnait extrêmement bien</i>. And then, turning round
    with a bow to his host, he finished up by saying that as
    another instance the English, the most democratic nation
    in the world, remained faithful to the Monarchical
    system, and could still love and honour their King.</p>
<p>The conversation turned later on the inevitable war
    of the future, that has now become the war of the
    past. It had always been understood that England&rsquo;s
    main contribution, in the event of a war of aggression,
    was to be her Navy, but that was not enough for
    Monsieur Clemenceau, and his parting words on
    taking leave of King Edward were prophetic: &ldquo;Surtout,
    Sire, soignez votre Armée.&rdquo; And if it be true, as is
    averred, that the war was virtually won by the Navy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span> it is surely equally true, that it was that eminently <i>soigné</i> article, the British Army of the first days of
    the war, that saved the situation and gave time for the
    power of the Navy to assert itself, and enable reinforcements,
    as soon as they could be raised and trained, to
    be sent literally from all parts of the world, to the
    battle-fronts where they were most needed, almost
    without let or hindrance.</p>
<p>The visit to Marienbad having been concluded, I
    was a free man again and could do my usual Scotch
    round of visits, and subsequently spend a month in
    mid-winter in the south of France. In February I
    was in attendance at Buckingham Palace, and, little as
    I realised it at the time, it was fated to be my last
    month of waiting on King Edward. As usual, London
    was full of influenza, and once more the King was
    persuaded to go to Brighton for a few days. On this
    occasion he was the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur
    Sassoon at King&rsquo;s Gardens, Hove, who had so often
    entertained him at Tulchan Lodge, Spey Side, which
    had also been, as I have mentioned before, one of the
    very happiest, of my own happy hunting-grounds.</p>
<p>After a week at Brighton the King was back at
    Buckingham Palace again, where Prince and Princess
    Henry of Prussia had arrived on a ten days&rsquo; visit, and
    on the 21st of the month, accompanied by Queen
    Alexandra, he opened his last Parliament.</p>
<p>During Prince Henry&rsquo;s stay at Buckingham Palace,
    he succeeded in giving me a curious example of that
    extraordinary mentality that is apparently a German
    peculiarity. He had been frequently employed as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span> sort of bagman by his brother, noticeably on his two
    visits, the first to the Far East, to exhibit the mailed
    fist, and secondly to the United States, in an effort that
    was made to win over the great heart of the American
    public. Like his brother, he had, when he liked, a
    considerable charm of manner, which could be produced
    when necessary, like the pulling out of a certain stop
    of an organ. And, like his brother, and indeed like
    most Prussians, he was a perfect specimen of <i>le faux
    bonhomme</i>. But judging from my own experience, I
    rather doubt his success as a political bagman, as
    I think he was inclined to believe that every Englishman
    he met, was sure to be overcome by his cordiality
    and condescension, and would consequently be prepared
    to accept, and subsequently retail, his invaluable
    confidences. For instance, at Buckingham Palace he
    kept me up until two in the morning once, <i>tête à tête</i>,
    apparently for the sole purpose of impressing on me
    that his brother was grossly ill-judged and misrepresented
    in England; that he really loved our
    country, and that the preparations that were being
    constantly made to perfect the German Army were
    solely in view of the impending danger that the
    Emperor, (who was the greatest genius and most far-seeing
    man in the world), was preparing against, and
    that was the Yellow Peril! His Imperial Majesty, so
    Prince Henry solemnly told me, was convinced that
    the yellow races in their countless millions would
    eventually invade Europe, and the German Army would
    prove to be its only saviour. I confess that I was not
    much impressed by this harangue, and, besides dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>liked
    the fact that I was evidently classed as &ldquo;the
    village idiot.&rdquo; Poetic justice would have attended the
    invasion of Eastern Europe by the Chinese, more
    especially if they got as far as Berlin, and recovered
    some of the priceless treasures looted from them by the
    German Expeditionary Force, at the time of the Boxer
    troubles.</p>
<p>After a stay of some ten days the Prince and Princess
    left the Palace, and my last month in waiting on King
    Edward came to an end.</p>
<p>Most of what remained of the year 1910 turned out
    to be one of the saddest times of my life. With the
    rest of my fellow-subjects I mourned the loss of a
    great King, but I had also lost the kindest master that
    ever man served, and one, moreover, who was not only
    a good master to his servants, but was also their best
    friend. My grief at the King&rsquo;s death was, if possible,
    more poignant owing to the circumstance that I had
    been obliged to change my month of waiting, and had
    consequently done duty in February instead of being
    with him at Biarritz in April as usual, in which case I
    should have had the melancholy satisfaction of always
    remembering that I had been with him until almost the
    last. The climate of Biarritz suited King Edward
    wonderfully well; though shortly after his arrival
    there he had been taken seriously ill, by the middle of
    April he was really better, revived by the strong
    air that blows home there from the Atlantic. So far
    as we all knew, he was well, when he returned to
    England, but a few days later, after his visit to
    Sandringham, the news began to leak out that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span> was not well with the King, so I hurried down to the
    Palace to inquire. Though it never occurred to those
    of us who had been long with him that any illness
    could possibly be fatal, so accustomed were we all to
    his wonderful vitality and powers of recuperation, yet
    on the morning of the 10th May there was no doubt
    but that he was very dangerously ill, and for the first
    time I felt really anxious. After mid-day, from what
    I could gather from those members of the Staff that I
    saw at Buckingham Palace, it looked as if he had begun
    to rally, so once again I was full of hope for the best.
    I went again after dinner, and then at last realised that,
    though he was still alive, his case was almost hopeless,
    and there I remained in the Equerries&rsquo; room, with
    several others of my brother Equerries, until the end
    came. When I left the Palace shortly after midnight,
    there was still that quiet and patient crowd of watchers
    outside the Palace gate waiting for the next bulletin.
    Alas! when it came it was to tell them that Edward
    VII had passed away. Many of the crowd had noticed
    that I had come out of the Palace, and I was waylaid
    by questioners. The demand was always the same&mdash;&ldquo;Was
    it true?&rdquo;&mdash;and when I was obliged to answer
    that it was, the almost invariable response was that it
    was impossible! The fact was that the man in the
    street loved him, and for that reason was for the
    moment quite unable to realise that any like ill could
    befall him; such a sudden end to that busy life appeared
    to be impossible. At the time I quite understood this
    attitude; to me, also, it seemed as if those long hours of
    suspense, waiting in the Equerries&rsquo; room before the fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span> news reached us, could only be an evil dream, that
    would be dispelled on the morrow.</p>
<p>For that mournful ceremonial the King&rsquo;s funeral I
    was attached to the Mission sent to represent the
    French Republic, the chief of which was M. Pichon,
    then Minister for Foreign Affairs. Practically all the
    civilised countries in the world were represented; the
    other great Republic, the United States of America, by
    a special Envoy in the person of Mr. Roosevelt, the
    Ex-President. The chief mourners besides the Royal
    Family were the German Emperor, the King&rsquo;s son-in-law,
    King Haakon of Norway, and his two brothers-in-law,
    the Kings of Denmark and of the Hellenes. The
    Kings of Spain, Portugal, Belgium, and Bulgaria were
    also present, and the heirs to the thrones of Austria,
    Turkey, Roumania, Serbia, and Montenegro. Other
    representatives were the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch
    of Russia, the Duke d&rsquo;Aosta and the Prince
    Consort of the Netherlands. One evening, by the
    kind invitation of Queen Alexandra, I was present at a
    small service held after nightfall in the Throne-room
    of Buckingham Palace, where the mortal remains of
    King Edward lay in state prior to the removal to
    Westminster Hall. Perhaps the most moving part of
    that very beautiful and simple service was the relieving
    of the Guard that happened to take place immediately
    after the conclusion of the office. During the whole of
    the lying-in-state at Buckingham Palace and Westminster
    Hall the coffin was guarded by the officers and
    men of the King&rsquo;s Company of the Grenadier Guards,
    four sentries standing at the four corners of the cata<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>falque
    by night and by day. These motionless figures
    standing on one of the steps of the catafalque, resting
    on their reversed arms and wearing their bearskins,
    looked gigantic in the interior of the room. The
    changing of the Guard (they were relieved every hour)
    was a wonderfully moving spectacle. The Officer of
    the Guard led the relief into the room, preceded by a
    small Drummer-boy carrying a lantern, exactly as the
    Sentries are relieved throughout the night outside the
    Royal Palaces. This tiny procession of armed men
    marching noiselessly through the Throne-room to
    take up the duty of guarding the mortal remains of
    their deceased Sovereign and Colonel-in-Chief was
    extraordinarily impressive. On the 16th the coffin was
    removed to Westminster Hall, where the lying-in-state
    lasted for four days, during which time I believe
    upwards of 400,000 persons passed through the Hall
    to take a silent farewell of their late King.</p>
<p>The interment took place in the St. George&rsquo;s Chapel,
    Windsor, and this was the last occasion that his Equerries
    were called upon to be in attendance on him. We
    marched by the side of the gun-carriage that was used
    as a bier, and lined up in the same position in the Choir
    of the Chapel, where, after the funeral service, the coffin
    was finally lowered into the family vault beneath it.
    A team of Horse Artillery was used as far as Paddington
    Station, but from Windsor Station to the
    Castle, passing through a portion of the town and up
    the commencement of the Long Walk to the Chapel,
    the gun-carriage was pulled by a party of Bluejackets
    from H.M.S. <i>Excellent</i>. The procession through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span> streets of London, with the immense crowd that lined
    the streets and literally swarmed the parks, was a
    marvellous sight, but the passage of the cortège up
    the Long Walk at Windsor to the entrance to the
    Castle was really beautiful, and never did Windsor
    Castle look more magnificent than on the 20th of
    May, when all that was mortal of King Edward VII
    was laid to rest.</p>
<p>It would not be becoming for me to argue on the
    merits or demerits of the much-discussed life of King
    Edward as it appears in the <i>Dictionary of National
    Biography</i>. A far better judge than I could ever
    pretend to be, and, moreover, a practised writer, in the
    person of the late Lord Redesdale, has left behind him his
    views on the subject, in the paper that was read before
    the Royal Society of Literature on April 23rd, 1915.
    I have that pamphlet, as it was subsequently printed,
    now in my possession, a greatly prized gift from the
    kind author, made to me not very long before he died.
    I can only say that I agree with every word of it, and
    that in my opinion no man in England was better
    qualified than the writer, to form a really just estimate
    of the character and attainments of King Edward VII.</p>
<p>Lord Redesdale was a very finished man of the
    world, and was also a man of very wide experience,
    having in his time been Diplomatist, Author, and
    Government Official, and in addition the late King and
    he shared a hobby,&mdash;landscape gardening,&mdash;and I am
    always inclined to think that men who happen to have
    the same hobby, are apt to know rather more of each
    other, than do their other friends and acquaintances.</p>

<p>As to the relations that existed between the King
    and his Ministers, I know nothing, but I have always
    understood that those of them that were brought
    most into contact with him, thoroughly recognised and
    appreciated his quick and strong grasp of great political
    questions, especially as relating to foreign politics, and
    the unerring instinct he had for brushing aside irrelevances
    and arriving at once at the heart of the business.
    Possibly Ministers may not have always realised that
    from the fact of his position and relationship with the
    various reigning Sovereigns (the French had not named
    him &ldquo;l&rsquo;Oncle de l&rsquo;Europe&rdquo; for nothing!), and also,
    from the amount of pains he had taken to make
    the personal acquaintance of the Ministers of foreign
    countries, he was apt to be better informed than was
    Downing Street. Moreover, he had a genius for doing
    the right thing. I remember during the official visit
    to Paris that I have already attempted to describe,
    when he proposed calling at the Hôtel de Ville, having
    to pass that building on his way to and from Vincennes
    for the Military Review, that was one of the
    functions arranged for his visit, every effort was made,
    especially by the French Authorities, to dissuade him.
    Fortunately he was, as usual, extremely firm. In vain
    was he told that the Hôtel de Ville was a hotbed
    of Socialism, and the headquarters of anti-monarchical
    feelings. He determined that if the City Fathers of
    Paris would receive him, nothing would deter him.
    His reception there was probably the greatest triumph
    of a very successful visit.</p>
<p>But the day has probably not yet arrived for History<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span> to pass its final verdict on Edward VII as a King. As
    a man, nothing to my mind can better sum up his
    character than do those very simple words, that stand
    engraved, under the east window of Sandringham
    Church:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="AFTERWORD" id="AFTERWORD">AFTERWORD</a></h2>
<p>Since King Edward&rsquo;s death I have had but few
    opportunities of being a spectator of events. Instead
    of travelling all over England and Europe on visits,
    official and otherwise, except for an occasional trip to
    the South of France, I have hardly left London.</p>
<p>During the very first week of the present reign
    His Majesty King George, with that extraordinary
    kindness and consideration that he has always shown
    towards his father&rsquo;s old servants and his own old
    comrades of the Navy, commanded me to Marlborough
    House, and there most graciously informed
    me that I might continue to occupy the rooms at
    St. James&rsquo; Palace that had been granted to me by
    the late King, and that, moreover, I was to receive
    the appointment of Groom-in-Waiting and Gentleman
    Usher. This dual office did not last very long, for
    when a vacancy occurred, through the death of General
    Sir Stanley Clarke, the King very kindly gave me the
    post of Sergeant-at-Arms in the House of Lords,
    which very pleasant appointment I still continue to
    hold, as well as another that I prize very highly,
    namely that of Extra Equerry to His Majesty the
    King.</p>
<p>During the few months that I was on the personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span> Staff of King George, I came in for one very interesting
    experience. Towards the end of the summer I
    was in attendance when the King, Queen Mary, and
    some of the younger members of the Royal Family,
    embarked on board the Royal Yacht for the purpose
    of witnessing the man&#339;uvres of the Home Fleet,
    then under the command of the present Admiral of
    the Fleet Sir Edward May. During these exercises the
    headquarters of the Fleet was Torbay, and there the <i>Victoria and Albert</i> generally anchored for the night,
    or remained during the day, while the King was on
    board one of the battleships of the Fleet. Though
    it is many years since I have served afloat, it is, even
    to this day, impossible for me to stand on the quarter-deck
    of a man-of-war without the sensation of being
    amongst familiar surroundings, so those days spent in
    the midst of old comrades were very pleasant ones,
    and remain to me as a very happy memory. I believe
    it was during that week that an aeroplane flew for the
    first time over a British Fleet. The plane in question
    was piloted by one of the pioneers of flying, who was
    giving an exhibition of aviation, and, naturally, seized
    such an opportunity as being the first man to fly over
    a British Fleet, a Fleet, moreover, that had the Royal
    Standard flying at a masthead. I have still among my
    belongings the photograph, here reproduced, of the
    King on the bridge of the flagship watching the
    movement of the plane as it approaches.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

        <p class="center">ON BOARD THE FLAGSHIP OF THE HOME FLEET, 1910</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the end of the year 1910 the health of my
    poor old friend, Stanley Clarke, became so bad that he
    was unable to carry on his duties at the House of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span> Lords as Sergeant-at-Arms, and it having been settled
    that I was to succeed him eventually, I officiated for
    him until the end of the session. Consequently, I am
    now about to commence the tenth year of my tenure
    there, and am becoming quite an old &ldquo;Officer of the
    House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day may come, perhaps, when there might be
    something written about events that have occurred, and
    speeches that have been made, in what the newspapers
    delight in calling the &ldquo;Gilded Chamber,&rdquo; but certainly
    as far as I am concerned the time is not yet, and meanwhile
    the only memory I will allow myself to mention
    is the passing of the Parliament Bill. For a man like
    myself, who has absolutely no politics, and is firmly
    convinced that the whole philosophy of governing and
    of government, is contained in the Abbé Jérome
    Coignard&rsquo;s delightful fable of the old woman of
    Syracuse, the assertions made across the table of the
    House are sometimes very interesting. Readers of
    Anatole France will remember that the old lady in
    question was living in Syracuse when the tyrant,
    Dionysius, was behaving more inhumanly than usual.
    Being asked by him why she daily prayed that his life
    should be spared, she replied, &ldquo;I am very old, and
    have lived under many tyrants, and I have always
    noticed that each in turn, has been worse than the last.
    You are the most detestable one that I have yet come
    across; from which I conclude that your successor will
    be even more cruel than you are, so I pray daily to the
    gods that his arrival may be postponed for as long as
    possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>
<p>So, in this philosophical frame of mind, I could
    watch the man&#339;uvres connected with that measure
    with the greatest interest and complete impartiality.
    I remember speculating (in the case of the Lords
    throwing out the Bill) whether that long list, of I
    forget exactly how many scores of Peers, all to be at
    once created, that was supposed to be in Lord Morley&rsquo;s
    pocket, ever really existed, or was only a gigantic bluff!
    My knowledge of politics was, and is, much too limited
    to enable me to form an opinion even now, but though
    knowing nothing of politics, I had played poker a good
    deal, and from that point of view I always believed the
    list to be a bluff, and a very successful one!</p>
<p>I have named these pages &ldquo;Looking Back,&rdquo; for
    the sufficient reason that, having permanently joined
    the ranks of the &ldquo;fogies,&rdquo; at my time of life it is
    pleasanter to look back than try to gaze into the
    future.</p>
<p>That life is beginning to be different, and is going
    to be increasingly so in this country, is a simple
    platitude, and whether the changes are going to be for
    the better or the worse, I know not. If the new order
    of things makes for the greater happiness of the greater
    number, then I suppose there is nothing more to be
    said, and &ldquo;everything is for the best in the best of
    worlds.&rdquo; The drawbacks seem, to my limited vision,
    to be that life will be apt to become terribly drab and
    level. The bricklayer having been long since limited
    as to the number of bricks he may lay, before long, Mr.
    Sargent may be limited by his Union to a fixed number
    of brush strokes, and that curious species of tyranny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span> might be extended to every Art and Craft in the
    kingdom. Worst of all, with increasing Government
    control, we shall be apt to lose our liberty, which has
    already diminished perceptibly during the last few
    years. Liberty seems to me to be the most precious
    of all possessions, and the only one that is really worthy
    of a League to protect it. During the war it was
    inevitable that all sorts of control had to be exercised,
    but now that war conditions no longer exist, we do not
    seem to have the fetters struck off our wrists as rapidly
    as could be wished. It is difficult to understand some
    of the anomalies of Government control; for instance,
    why should dancing-halls be allowed to be kept open
    until two in the morning, whilst the inmates of respectable
    old-fashioned clubs are hounded into the street
    at 12 or 12.30, according to the day of the week?
    I am all for freedom, and am entirely in favour of the
    dancing-places being open all night if the proprietors
    prefer it, always supposing that ordinary clubs are
    allowed to live under their own rules. Personally, the
    much-criticised existing liquor control seems to me to
    be not only tyrannical, but ridiculous. I was brought
    up to believe that Magee was one of the ablest of our
    Churchmen of his own, or of any other time. He it
    was, who, in a great speech delivered in the House of
    Lords used the words, &ldquo;I should say that it would be
    better that England should be free, than that England
    should be compulsorily sober,&rdquo; and I entirely agree
    with him.</p>
<p>History teaches us that democracies in all times have
    been opposed to liberty, and it is the possible loss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span> freedom in the future that seems to me to be the
    coming danger to our beloved country. I am, in my
    humble way, as ardent a lover of liberty as was the
    poet Heine himself, so it is no comfort to feel that
    though this England of ours will surely survive the
    succeeding Governments, that will have charge of its
    destinies, each of which, according to Monsieur Anatole
    France, must automatically be worse than the last, its
    prosperity will avail us nothing, should we lose our
    most precious heritage, namely&mdash;our liberty.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
